	\section{Gravitational Physics Summary -- Physics Part}

\rem{we use units of $c = G = 1$ (\Def{geometric units})}

\rem{we adopt the Einstein summation convention where repeated indices are summed over, that is abbreviating $\sum_\mu x^\mu y_\mu = x^\mu y_\mu$}

		\subsection{Newtonian Gravity}
Newtonian gravity can be captured by his famous formula
\begin{equation}
\eqbox{
F_g = - \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
}
\end{equation}
which describes the gravitational force that an object with mass $m_1$ exerts onto another object with mass $m_2$ (from Newton's second law, we know that the same force is exerted from the second object onto the first)


this can also be brought into the form
\begin{equation}\label{eq:newton_potential}
F_g = m_2 \dv{r}\qty(\frac{m_1}{r}) = - m_2 \dv{\Phi_g}{r}
\end{equation}
which tells us that gravitation is a conservative force with potential $\Phi_g = - \frac{m_1}{r}$ (produced by some object with mass $m_1$). This is because it only has a radial and no angular component (thinking in polar/spherical coordinates) such that any derivative with respect to angular coordinates such as $\pdv{\Phi_g}{\theta}$ vanishes. Thus, \eqref{eq:newton_potential} is equivalent to the more general condition for conservative forces,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cons_force}
\eqbox{
\vec{F} = - \vec{\nabla} \Phi
}
\manyqquad
F^k = - \delta^{k l} \pdv{\Phi}{x^l} \, .
\end{equation}
as a consequence, knowing the potential is sufficient to know how gravity acts; for a point particle, we can determine it from $\Delta \Phi = \nabla^2 \Phi = 0$ and for a continuous mass distribution $\rho\qty(\vec{x})$ from
\begin{equation}\label{eq:field_eq_newton}
\eqbox{
\Delta \Phi\qty(\vec{x}) = 4 \pi \rho\qty(\vec{x})
}
\manyqquad
\delta^{ij} \pdv[2]{\Phi(\vec{x})}{x^i}{x^j} = 4 \phi \rho\qty(\vec{x})
\end{equation}

on this note, it is important to mention that instead forces $\vec{F}$ are also equivalent to accelerations $\vec{a}$ (due to Newton's second law $\vec{F} = m \vec{a}$) and momenta $\vec{p}$ (due to $\vec{F} = \dv{\vec{p}}{\tau}$)


\begin{ex}[Gravity on Earth]
The gravity exerted by Earth on objects with mass $m$ (assuming they stand on Earth's surface for now) is
\begin{equation}
F_g = - m \frac{m_e}{r_e^2} = - m g
\end{equation}
Comparing that with Newton's second formula, $F = m a$, we see that such an object experiences an acceleration
\begin{equation}
a = - g = - 9.81 \frac{\metre}{\second^2} = - 1.1 \cdot 10^{-16} \frac{1}{\metre} \, .
\end{equation}

To see how much potential energy is needed to lift objects of mass $m$ to a height $h \ll r_e$ above Earth's surface, we can do a Taylor expansion around $h = 0$:
\begin{align*}
\Phi_g = - \frac{m_e}{r_e + h} &\simeq - \eval{\frac{m_e}{r_e + h}}_{h = 0} + h \eval{\dv{h}\qty(- \frac{m_e}{r_e + h})}_{h = 0} + \mathcal{O}(h^2)
\\
&= - \frac{m_e}{r_e} + h \eval{\frac{m_e}{(r_e + h)^2}}_{h = 0} + \mathcal{O}(h^2)
\\
&= - \frac{m_e}{r_e} + h \frac{m_e}{r_e^2} + \mathcal{O}(h^2) = - \frac{m_e}{r_e} + h g + \mathcal{O}(h^2)
\end{align*}
%From that, we obtain the gravitational potential energy at $h$ to first order as the difference
However, the first contribution is nothing but the energy at Earth's surface. The potential energy that at $h$ and thus the energy which is needed to lift an object of mass $m$ to this height $h$ (which is what one is interested in most of the time) is given to first order by the difference
\begin{equation}
\Phi_g =  - \frac{m_e}{r_e} + g h - - \frac{m_e}{r_e} = g h \, .
\end{equation}
This corresponds to gauging our measurements such that Earth's surface is the value with zero potential energy.
\end{ex}


problem: the Newtonian description of gravity as a force is not consistent with relativity because it acts instantaneously



turns out that gravitational mass and inertial mass are equal


\begin{ex}[Gravitational Redshift]
somehow we could build perpetual motion machine is the argument, don't get it

I rather think about it like this (should be equivalent): SR tells us that photons have a certain mass $m = \frac{E}{c^2}$; therefore, it is also affected by a gravitational potential and to move against gravity, some of its energy has to be converted; that corresponds to a change in frequency, (since $f = \frac{E}{h}$):
\begin{equation}
\frac{f_\text{top}}{f_\text{bottom}} = \frac{E_\text{top}}{E_\text{bottom}} = \frac{m - m g h}{m} = 1 - g h
\end{equation}
\rem{in script, this is only true to first order, so derivation might be wrong... Result there reads $\frac{1}{m + m g h}$. Ahhh, because there things are defined differently: photon starts from top, thus it has more energy at ground}
\end{ex}

natural consequence because time is inversely proportional to frequency (time differences are): clocks tick faster at higher altitude, i.e.~for a stronger gravitational potential



%reason for puzzling and seemingly inconsistent results: a frame where gravity acts is \emph{not} inertial (because we have external force in gravity, right?)!



	\subsection{Special Relativity}
\begin{defi}[Inertial Frame]
An \Def{intertial frame of reference} is a coordinate frame where $\vec{F} = m \vec{a}$ holds. In particular, that means objects move with constant speed when no force is acting on them.
\end{defi}

there is no unique inertial frame; all laws of physics have to hold equally in all inertial frames; therefore, only quantities which are invariant under transformations between inertial frames have physical meaning

we can always get other inertial frames from existing ones by looking at some which move with constant speed with respect to them; as a consequence, coordinates of events have no physical meanings; however, distances between events turn out to have an invariant (and thus physical) meaning:
\begin{align*}
\qty(\Delta s)^2 &= - \qty(\Delta t)^2 + \qty(\Delta x)^2 + \qty(\Delta y)^2 + \qty(\Delta z)^2
\\
&= \underline{\Delta x} \cdot \eta \cdot \underline{\Delta x} = \mqty(\Delta t & \Delta x & \Delta y & \Delta z) \cdot \mqty(-1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1) \cdot \mqty(\Delta t \\ \Delta x \\ \Delta y \\ \Delta z)
\\
&= \eta_{\mu \nu} \qty(\Delta x)^\mu \qty(\Delta x)^\nu = \qty(\Delta x)^\mu \qty(\Delta x)_\mu
\end{align*}
making these differences $\Delta$ infinitesimally small, i.e.~by going to $ds^2 := \qty(ds)^2$, we obtain the line element of the metric $\eta$



let us now think about gravity in special relativity; in principle, we keep the Newtonian description, but some effects can be examined in different manner now (we have new notion/tool of inertial frame for example)

regarding gravitational redshift: reason for puzzling and seemingly inconsistent results: a frame where gravity acts is \emph{not} inertial (because we have external force in gravity, right?)!

task: finding a reference frame where the effect of gravity is not present; obviously, earths surface is not sufficient and neither is a uniformly moving one; however, in free fall we experience no gravity, that is a freely falling frame cancels out the effect of gravity

we now state this more formally

\begin{prop}[Weak Equivalence Principle]
The effects of a gravitational field are indistinguishable from an accelerated frame of reference.
\end{prop}
so basically: only in a freely falling frame we can cancel out the effect of gravity and create an inertial frame on earth


\begin{prop}[Einstein Equivalence Principle]
The laws of physics in a freely falling frame are locally described by SR without gravity. Such a frame is called \Def[local inertial frame]{local inertial frame (LIF)}.
\end{prop}
speaking strictly mathematically, \enquote{locally} means in an infinitesimally small neighbourhood of points; how much this can be extended in practice depends on the physical effects of interest

moreover, there is no global frame for Earth and no uniform direction of acceleration



from experience we know about gravity that
\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] all bodies which start with the same initial velocity move through a gravitational field along the same curve

\item[(b)] bodies which move initially parallel to each other in a freely falling frame do not necessarily move parallel at all times if an external gravitational field is present (this effect is due to \Def{tidal forces} acting on them)
\end{itemize}

Property (b) can be further examined and quantified. To do that, we note that for a particle with world line $x^k(\tau)$ we have
\begin{equation*}
\dv[2]{x^k}{\tau} = - \delta^{k l} \pdv{\Phi}{x^l} = - \delta^{k l} \eval{\pdv{\Phi}{x^l}}_{\vec{x}}
\end{equation*}
because of \eqref{eq:cons_force} and Newton's second law $F^k = m \dv[2]{x^k}{\tau}$.

Similarly, for another particle starting close to the first one (i.e.~with world line $x^k + \xi^k$, where $\abs{\xi^k \xi_k} \ll 1$)
\begin{align*}
\dv[2]{\qty(x^k + \xi^k)}{\tau} &= - \delta^{k l} \eval{\pdv{\Phi}{x^l}}_{\vec{x} + \vec{\xi}}
\\
&\simeq - \delta^{k l} \eval{\pdv{\Phi}{x^l}}_{\vec{x}} - \delta^{k l} \xi^m \pdv{x^m} \eval{\pdv{\Phi}{x^l}}_{\vec{x}}
\end{align*}
where we made use of a Taylor approximation to first order. Since derivatives are linear, we obtain
\begin{equation}\label{eq:tidal_newton}
\eqbox{
\dv[2]{\xi}{\tau} = \dv[2]{\qty(x^k + \xi^k)}{\tau} - \dv[2]{x^k}{\tau} = - \delta^{k l} \pdv[2]{\Phi}{x^m}{x^l} \, \xi^m
}
\end{equation}
	\rem{note that the evaluation is still at the point $\vec{x}$, not at something related to $\xi^k$!}
This is the \Def{Newtonian deviation equation}. We see that tidal forces are governed by the tidal acceleration tensor $\pdv[2]{\Phi}{x^m}{x^l}$. Tidal forces are a way to detect gravity as opposed to constant acceleration (which would affect the world lines $x^k$ and $x^k + \xi^k$ equally)



	\subsection{Curved Spacetime}
One problem in SR is that the Newtonian description of gravity is still taken to be valid. That, however, is a problem because there are many inconsistencies between them, for example the instantaneous effect of gravity (gravitational redshift is also puzzling). However, we can come up with generalized description: for anybody familiar with differential/Riemannian geometry, the effects (a), (b) of gravity stated above sound very much like the ones associated with a curved space. This motivates the (mathematical) description of gravity as a geometrical effect in Minkowskian spacetime (which will become a curved space in this process). Many relations known from SR will remain, but with different quantities and most prominently, a different metric other than $\eta$. The basic goal of \Def{general relativity} (GR) will be to find ways to derive the metric which contains information about spacetime curvature and thus gravity.\\


say something about how LIF can be characterized using metric; is important we always want to recover results in there, for example statements on timelike etc. (around 2.36)\\


The most basic thing we need to know is how test particles move in curved spaces. We will start with the case where no force is present, i.e.~free movement. The Newtonian theory/SR gives us $\ddot{\vec{a}} = 0$ and thus a movement on straight lines. This has to be reproduced locally (that is in a LIF), but originating from a more general concept. Finding this generalization is based on the observation that tangent vectors remain constant along straight lines. That leads to the \Def{geodesic equation}
\begin{equation}
\eqbox{
\nabla_{\underline{t}} t^\beta = t^\alpha \nabla_\alpha t^\beta = 0
}\, ,
\end{equation}
which just expresses that $t^\beta$ remains constant as long as we take the derivative along the curve that it is tangent to (which explains the $t^\alpha \nabla_\alpha$ part). Consequently, the world lines test particles are \Def{geodesics}.

One can obtain the same statement from a completely different approach: by demanding that world lines are the curves in Minkowski space which extremize the proper time/distance
\begin{equation}
\tau_{AB} = \int_A^B d\tau = \int_A^B \sqrt{- g_{\alpha \beta} dx^\alpha dx^\beta} = \int_0^1 \sqrt{- g_{\alpha \beta} \dv{x^\alpha}{\sigma} \dv{x^\beta}{\sigma}} \, d\sigma
\end{equation}
between two events $A, B$.

In both cases, we obtain the following coordinate version of the geodesic equation:
\begin{equation}
\eqbox{
\dv[2]{x^\beta}{\sigma} + \Gamma_{\alpha \delta}^\beta \dv{x^\alpha}{\sigma} \dv{x^\delta}{\sigma}
}
\end{equation}

\begin{proof}
In the first approach, we use
\begin{align*}
t^\alpha \nabla_\alpha t^\beta &= \dv{x^\alpha}{\sigma} \nabla_\alpha \dv{x^\beta}{\sigma}
\\
&= \dv{x^\alpha}{\sigma} \qty(\pdv{x^\alpha} \dv{x^\beta}{\sigma} + \Gamma_{\alpha \delta}^\beta \dv{x^\delta}{\sigma})
\\
&= \dv{x^\alpha}{\sigma} \pdv{x^\alpha} \dv{x^\beta}{\sigma} + \Gamma_{\alpha \delta}^\beta \dv{x^\alpha}{\sigma} \dv{x^\delta}{\sigma}
\\
\underset{\text{chain rule}}&{=} \dv{\sigma} \dv{x^\beta}{\sigma} + \Gamma_{\alpha \delta}^\beta \dv{x^\alpha}{\sigma} \dv{x^\delta}{\sigma}
\\
&= \dv[2]{x^\beta}{\sigma} + \Gamma_{\alpha \delta}^\beta \dv{x^\alpha}{\sigma} \dv{x^\delta}{\sigma} \, .
\end{align*}

In the second approach, we derive the Euler-Lagrange equations by varying the proper time integral:
\begin{equation}
\eqbox{
\pdv{L}{x^\alpha} = \dv{\sigma} \pdv{L}{dx^\alpha / d\sigma}
}
\end{equation}
where we introduced the Lagrangian
\begin{equation}
\eqbox{
L = L\qty(x^\alpha, \dv{x^\alpha}{\sigma}) = \sqrt{- g_{\alpha \beta} \dv{x^\alpha}{\sigma} \dv{x^\beta}{\sigma}}
} \, .
\end{equation}
Notable and useful properties in this context are that $L$ is constant along the geodesic because
\begin{align*}
\dv{\sigma} \qty(g_{\alpha \beta} \dv{x^\alpha}{\sigma} \dv{x^\beta}{\sigma}) &= t^\gamma \partial_\gamma \qty(g_{\alpha \beta} t^\alpha t^\beta) = t^\gamma \nabla_\gamma \qty(g_{\alpha \beta} t^\alpha t^\beta)
\\
&= t^\alpha t^\beta \nabla_\gamma g_{\alpha \beta} + g_{\alpha \beta} t^\beta t^\gamma \nabla_\gamma t^\alpha + g_{\alpha \beta} t^\alpha t^\gamma \nabla_\gamma t^\beta = 0 \, .
\end{align*}
Note that this does \emph{not} imply $\partial_\alpha L = 0$ (so the Euler-Lagrange equations still make sense). It does, however, mean that we are free to change the parametrization from $\sigma$ to any \Def{affine parameter} $\sigma' = a \sigma + b, \; a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ while only picking up a factor $\frac{1}{a}$. The proper time $\tau$ is defined as the parameter $\sigma'$ with
\begin{equation}
L = 1 \qquad \Leftrightarrow \qquad g_{\alpha \beta} \dv{x^\alpha}{\tau} \dv{x^\beta}{\tau} = -1
\end{equation}
which comes from the known normalization of the four-velocity $U^\alpha = \dv{x^\alpha}{\tau}$. Therefore, we can always replace $d\sigma \rightarrow d\tau = L d\sigma$ or vice versa.
\end{proof}
The advantage of having two approaches is that, in some cases, calculating the Christoffel symbols might be easier or might have already been done, while in others the Euler-Lagrange equations reveal very useful properties of the problem/system (for example in case one coordinate does not appear explicitly in $L$; then, we have immediately found a quantity which is conserved by the system, i.e.~it does not change as time evolves/as we vary $\sigma$ when going along the geodesic, this quantity being $\pdv{L}{dx^\alpha / d\sigma}$).

A physical consequence from $L = \text{const}$ is that geodesics/world lines which are timelike/null/spacelike somewhere have this property everywhere! Test particles (with mass $m > 0$) always move along timelike geodesics while massless particles like photons move along null geodesics (spacelike ones violate causality).



		\subsection{Weakly Curved Spacetimes}
basic idea here: re-derive first subsection from GR (confirm that it reproduces Newtonian results), that is using the spacetime metric
\begin{equation}
ds^2 = - \qty(1 + 2 \Phi) dt^2 + \qty(1 - 2\Phi) \qty(dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2)
\end{equation}
which is the first order approximation in case the Newtonian potential $\Phi = - \frac{m}{r}$ fulfils $\abs{\Phi} \ll 1$; we will see where it comes from later on, will be used as motivation for now\\


we can formulate the geodesic equation for test particles in many ways, for example
\begin{equation}
U^\alpha \nabla_\alpha U^\beta = 0 \manyqquad p^\alpha \nabla_\alpha p^\beta
\end{equation}
where $U^\alpha = \dv{x^\alpha}{\tau}$ is the four-velocity of a particle with world line $x^\alpha$ and $p^\alpha = m U^\alpha$ is the four-momentum (sometimes preferred quantity because it is well-defined also for photons)

for the first/time component $p^0 = E \approx m$ ($c^2 = 1$, this is an approximation to lowest order) we obtain
\begin{equation}
0 = m \dv{p^0}{\tau} + \Gamma^0_{\alpha \beta} p^\alpha p^\beta \approx m \dv{p^0}{\tau} + \Gamma^0_{0 0} \qty(p^0)^2 \qquad \Leftrightarrow \qquad \dv{p^0}{\tau} \approx - m \pdv{\Phi}{t}
\end{equation}
which matches the Newtonian result that if the gravitational field does not change over time, then the energy $p^0$ will be conserved over time

similarly, the equations for the spatial components
\begin{equation}
0 = m \dv{p^k}{\tau} + \Gamma^k_{\alpha \beta} p^\alpha p^\beta \approx m \dv{p^k}{\tau} + \Gamma^k_{0 0} m^2 \qquad \Leftrightarrow \qquad \dv{p^k}{\tau} \approx - m \delta^{k l} \pdv{\Phi}{x^l}
\end{equation}
match the Newtonian result \eqref{eq:cons_force} that gravity acts as a conservative force\\


in the Newtonian case, tidal forces \eqref{eq:tidal_newton} could be used to detect gravity as opposed to constant acceleration; something similar should be possible for curvature (which is how we described gravity now) and indeed, we obtain
\begin{equation*}
\eqbox{
\nabla_{\underline{U}} \nabla_{\underline{U}} \xi^\beta = U^\sigma \nabla_\sigma U^\alpha \nabla_\alpha \xi^\beta = - R^\beta{}_{\gamma \delta \epsilon} U^\gamma \xi^\delta U^\epsilon
} \, .
\end{equation*}
Therefore, gravity/curvature is determined and measured by the \Def{Riemann curvature tensor}
\begin{equation}
\eqbox{
R^\beta{}_{\gamma \delta \epsilon} = \pdv{\Gamma^\beta{}_{\gamma \epsilon}}{x^\delta} - \pdv{\Gamma^\beta{}_{\gamma \delta}}{x^\epsilon} + \Gamma^\beta{}_{\delta \mu} \Gamma^\mu{}_{\gamma \epsilon} - \Gamma^\beta{}_{\epsilon \mu} \Gamma^\mu{}_{\gamma \delta}
} \, .
\end{equation}
A helpful way to think about the Riemann tensor is as the \enquote{difference}/commutator of subsequent derivatives, which is motivated by the following equation:
\begin{equation}
\eqbox{
\qty[\nabla_\alpha, \nabla_\beta] V^\mu = R^\mu{}_{\gamma \alpha \beta} V^\gamma
} \, .
\end{equation}


We can simplify this equation by choosing a LIF with $\underline{e'_0} = \underline{e_\tau}$ (one basis vector along proper time). Since this coordinate system is parallel transported along the geodesic,
\begin{equation*}
U^\gamma \nabla_\gamma \dv{x'^\beta}{x^\alpha} = U^\gamma \nabla_\gamma \qty(\underline{e'^\beta})_\alpha = 0
\end{equation*}
and we obtain
\begin{equation}
\dv[2]{\xi^\beta}{\tau} = \pdv{x'^\beta}{x^\alpha} U^\sigma \nabla_\sigma U^\delta \nabla_\delta \xi^\alpha = - \pdv{x'^\beta}{x^\alpha} R^\alpha{}_{\gamma \delta \epsilon} \pdv{x^\gamma}{\tau} \xi^\delta \pdv{x^\epsilon}{\tau} = - R'^\beta{}_{\tau \delta \tau} \xi'^\delta
\end{equation}
	\rem{note that the evaluation is still at the point $\vec{x}$, not at something related to $\xi^k$!}
due to the transformation law for vectors and tensors (?). This equation looks very much like the Newtonian expression \eqref{eq:tidal_newton}. Moreover, we see that the Riemann tensor might play a role which is similar to the tidal acceleration tensor $\pdv[2]{\Phi}{x^m}{x^l}$. Hence, it might also play a similar role in causing gravity...



	\subsection{Einstein Equation}
We have seen how Newtonian theory can be generalized, for example by going from a potential $\Phi$ for the gravity field to the metric $g_{\mu \nu}$. Many effects could be derived from that, e.g.~equations of motion and the effect of gravity in tidal forces -- but we have no way of determining the metric yet! Thus, we will now look for a field equation like \eqref{eq:field_eq_newton}. As it turns out, there is no way of truly deriving the result. Instead, we can only motivate it sufficiently.\\


First of all, we need an analogue to the mass distribution $\rho\qty(\vec{x})$ to describe the effect of matter. This should be a tensorial quantity in accordance with previous generalizations.


This definition also allows to summarize several conservation formulas into one, coordinate-independent equation:
\begin{equation}
\nabla_\alpha T^{\alpha \beta} = 0 \, .
\end{equation}
This gives us
\begin{equation}
\partial_t \rho + \partial_i \pi^i = 0 \manyqquad \partial_t \pi^i + \partial_j T^{i j} = 0
\end{equation}
which corresponds to energy and momentum conservation (which is the continuum version of $F^k = m a^k$ since spatial components of the stress-energy tensor describe forces).\\


Now that we have something which causes gravity, we need to equate it with something that describes gravity -- a natural quantity would be the Riemann tensor $R^\alpha{}_{\beta \gamma \delta}$. However, the stress-energy tensor only has two indices, while the Riemann tensor has four. Thus, we have to get rid of two indices, which can be done by contraction. Since $T = T^\alpha{}_\alpha \neq 0$, we are only interested a $2$-tensor trace component, which turns out to be the \Def{Ricci tensor} 
\begin{equation}
\eqbox{
R_{\alpha \beta} = R^\mu{}_{\alpha \mu \beta}
} = R_{\beta \alpha} \, .
\end{equation}

However, the Ricci tensor is not divergent free, so a field equation of the kind $R^{\alpha \beta} = b T^{\alpha \beta}$ cannot hold. Luckily, we can construct divergent-free tensor from it by rearranging
\begin{equation*}
\nabla_\alpha R^{\alpha \beta} = \frac{1}{2} g^{\alpha \beta} \nabla_\alpha R
\end{equation*}
which can be obtained using the Bianchi identity. Since $\nabla_\alpha g^{\alpha \beta} = 0$,
\begin{equation}
\nabla_\alpha \qty(R^{\alpha \beta} - \frac{1}{2} g^{\alpha \beta} R) = 0
\end{equation}
and we see that the \Def{Einstein tensor}
\begin{equation}
\eqbox{
G^{\alpha \beta} = R^{\alpha \beta} - \frac{1}{2} g^{\alpha \beta} R = G^{\beta \alpha}
}
\end{equation}
fulfils the required conservation law. Here, $R$ is the \Def{Ricci scalar} (or \Def{scalar curvature})
\begin{equation}
\eqbox{
R = R^\alpha_\alpha
} \, ,
\end{equation}
part of another trace component of the Riemann tensor. Thus, the field equation of interest (also called \Def{Einstein equation}) is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:einstein1}
\eqbox{
G^{\alpha \beta} = 8 \pi T^{\alpha \beta}
}
\end{equation}
where the constant of proportionality $8 \pi$ is determined by requiring that they reduce to the Newtonian weak-field limit. Now, remembering that $\nabla_\gamma g^{\alpha \beta} = 0$ tells us we are free to add a term of the kind $a g^{\alpha \beta}$ to the field equation. Therefore,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:einstein2}
\eqbox{
G^{\alpha \beta} + \Lambda g^{\alpha \beta} = 8 \pi T^{\alpha \beta}
}
\end{equation}
is an equally valid version of the Einstein equation. $\Lambda$ is the (in)famous \Def{cosmological constant} and its contribution can be thought of as \enquote{stress-energy of empty space}. However, this can be absorbed in $T^{\alpha \beta}$, so we will mostly stick to using \eqref{eq:einstein1}. The Einstein equation can be interpreted following this famous quote by John Archibald Wheeler:
\begin{center}
\enquote{\textit{Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.}}
\end{center}

%-> we need something with two indices now... To see how that might go, we can decompose Riemann tensor into part with non-vanishing and vanishing trace; since $T = T^\alpha{}_\alpha \neq 0$, we are only interested a $2$-tensor trace component, which turns out to be the \Def{Ricci tensor} $R_{\alpha \beta} = R^\mu{}_{\alpha \mu \beta}$ (is symmetric); the other trace component is (proportional to) the \Def{Ricci scalar} $R = R^\alpha{}_\alpha$, but this is not a tensor, so we will omit it for now

%-> problem: Ricci tensor is not divergent free, but has to be fulfilled if equal to $T^{\alpha \beta}$! However, we can construct divergent-free tensor from it by rearranging the result $\nabla_\alpha R^{\alpha \beta} = \frac{1}{2} g^{\alpha \beta} \nabla_\alpha R$ which can be obtained using the Bianchi identity; since $\nabla_\alpha g^{\alpha \beta} = 0$, $\nabla_\alpha \qty(R^{\alpha \beta} - \frac{1}{2} g^{\alpha \beta} R) =: \nabla_\alpha G^{\alpha \beta} = 0$ and we see that the \Def{Einstein tensor} $G^{\alpha \beta}$ fulfils the required conservation law.


To simplify things one can look empty space first, where $T^{\alpha \beta} = T = 0$. For the Einstein equation, that means
\begin{equation*}
G^{\alpha \beta} = 0 \, .
\end{equation*}
But since trace of the Einstein equation yields $R = - 8 \pi T$ ($= 0$ in vacuum), we obtain the following \Def{vacuum Einstein equation}:
\begin{equation}
\eqbox{
R^{\alpha \beta} = 0
} \, .
\end{equation}


Now we will come to few examples of solutions of the Einstein equation.% (spoiler: there are not too many).
\begin{ex}[Solutions of the Einstein equation]
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Minkowski


\item Schwarzschild


\item weak Newtonian potential is Schwarzschild far away from source (we define a certain potential and make a gauge transformation)
\end{enumerate}
\end{ex}
As we can see, there are not too many analytical solutions. This is because the Einstein equation forms a coupled system of partial differential equations, which makes them very hard to solve in general (even numerically).
