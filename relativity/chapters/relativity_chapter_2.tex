\begin{center}
In modern day (theoretical) physics, I personally feel like there are two competing viewpoints. One is very much based on intuition and the other is based almost solely on a mathematical description. This shows especially in the theory of special relativity, where one can deal (i) in much detail with groups and transformations or (ii) with a much more pictorial version of the theory, mostly utilizing very basic geometry in so-called spacetime diagrams.

Both approaches can lead to a rich and of course equivalent understanding, but it is often tempting to focus on only one of them. In my own experience, this is mostly the mathematical description because students are often more familiar with the required math, so teaching the alternative and rather new intuitive-based approach would actually be more complicated. This, however, can often lead to a lack of intuition, which is still fundamental to fully understand and embrace relativity as a whole. For this reason, the (admittedly, quite ambitious) goal of this summary is to treat both approaches. In this chapter, we will start by dealing with the intuitive approach.

% Good sources: Nolting + Meinel; also Giulini + Dragon
Sir Isaac Newton shaped the way physics was made for decades with his work \enquote{Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica} from 1687, which essentially founded the theory of classical mechanics. We will go briefly over the most important insights and notions needed to understand relativity.

-> note that they hold for test mass!

It is based on the following principles.
\begin{post}[Newton's Laws of Motion]
	\begin{enumerate}[1.]
		\item Every body remains at rest or in a uniform motion, unless a force acts upon it.

		\item If a force $\vec{F}$ acts upon an object of mass $m$, it causes an acceleration
		\begin{equation}\label{eq:newton_second_law}
			\eqbox{
				\vec{F} = m \vec{a} = m \dv[2]{\vec{r}}{t}
			}
			% \manyqquad
			% \eqbox{
			% 	F^k = m a^k = m \ddot{r}^k
			% }
			\, .
		\end{equation}

		\item If two bodies exert forces on each other, these forces have the same magnitude but opposite directions (\enquote{actio = reactio}),
		\begin{equation}\label{eq:newton_third_law}
			\eqbox{
				\vec{F}_{12} = - \vec{F}_{21}
			}
			% \manyqquad
			% \eqbox{
			% 	F_{12}^k = - F_{21}^k
			% }
			\, .
		\end{equation}
	\end{enumerate}
\end{post}
These axioms define how objects (which are sometimes given the abstract name \Def{observer} $\mathcal{O}$; these give us viewpoints to describe physics from) experience physics. In order to describe this action mathematically, we also need explicit ways to assign the position of observers to points $\vec{r} \in \mathbb{R}^3$ in the Euclidean space we live in. Such an assignment is what physicists call \Def{coordinates} or \Def{frames}.

following Thorne + Blandford in Sec.~1.4, emphasize how we can formulate Newtons laws entirely geometrically, without any coordinates! Of course, we \emph{can} use coordinates (as we do frequently, by writing laws in terms of components), but there is no \emph{need} to do so. This is very special -> this will be true for all of relativity! -> is it, really? In any case, note this down!

-> component forms of laws are not necessarily always true, we can have non-constant basis vectors!


Newton's laws have rich implications, some of which we discuss now.



			\paragraph{First Law}
The first law tells us something about which special class of frames is suitable to describe physics.
\begin{defi}[Inertial Frame]
	An \Def[inertial frame]{inertial frame (of reference)} is a frame where $F^k = m a^k$ holds.
\end{defi}
% Basically, if you put a ball in front of you and let it go, then you are in an inertial frame if the ball just remains where it is.

For this to be valid, either $\vec{r}$ or $\vec{v}$ have to be constant (both direction and magnitude) in this inertial frame if $\vec{F} = 0$, which is exactly what Newton's first law imposes. From the definition we can also see that there is no unique inertial frame because we can always get other inertial frames from existing ones by looking at frames which move with constant speed with respect to them.

A very important realization is that all inertial frames are suited equally well to describe physics because the laws of physics do not depend on the frame we choose:
\begin{equation}
	\vec{F} = m \vec{a} = m \dv{\vec{v}_1(t)}{t} = m \dv{\vec{v}_2(t)}{t}
\end{equation}
as long as $\vec{v}_1 - \vec{v}_2 = \text{const}$. Therefore, while the values of $\vec{v}_1$ and $\vec{v}_2$ might differ and thus depend on the inertial frame we choose, the physics inferred from them does not (forces are what we observe \todo{but this is not decisive factor, is it? Is simply that interplay of chosen coordinates and forces acting in them is always equivalent}). This explains the preferred role of inertial frames when describing physics. Laws stated in inertial frames hold in all of them, while laws in non-inertial frames do not, whence it is often non-trivial to find out whether effects can be attributed to some physical process or to the frame/coordinates used to describe the situation (for example, the Coriolis force is needed to explain effects on Earth's surface, which is a rotating and thus non-inertial frame of reference).\\


If all inertial frames are suited equally well to describe physics, one might ask if a relation between them exists, i.e.~if there are ways to transform between inertial frames. Besides coordinate transformations (for example from Cartesian to spherical coordinates), which we will not discuss further here, the other possible transformation is between uniformly moving frames. These changes are admitted by the \Def{Galilei transform} and assuming the velocity $v$ to be in $x$-direction, this maps coordinates $(x, y, z)$ according to
\begin{equation}\label{eq:galilei}
	\eqbox{
		x \rightarrow x' = x + v t
	}
	\qquad \qquad
	\eqbox{
		y \rightarrow y' = y
	}
	\qquad \qquad
	\eqbox{
		z \rightarrow z' = z
	} \, .
\end{equation}


While all inertial frames yield equivalent physical statements, this is not the case for the way that Newton envisioned them to be defined: he assumed the existence of a \enquote{master frame} that is known to be \enquote{truly inertial}, and every other inertial frame to be defined with respect to this one. In other words, Newton believed in the concept of an \Def{absolute space}, through this \enquote{master frame}.



			\paragraph{Second Law}
The second law is probably the second most famous formula in physics. It is a special case of constant mass $m = \text{const.}$ of the formula\footnote{Some people set things up differently and introduce Eq.~\eqref{eq:newton_2} as the second law.}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:newton_2}
	\eqbox{
		\vec{F} = \dv{\vec{p}}{t}
	}
	% \manyqquad
	% \eqbox{
	% 	F^k = \dv{p^k}{t}
	% }
\end{equation}
that relates forces to \Def{momenta} $\vec{p} = m \vec{v}$. Because of their relation to forces, some fundamental principles involve momenta. 

-> mention that they do have kind of abstract meaning, hard to grasp... 


In either form, the second law determines dynamics in the Newtonian physics.



-> multiple forces acting together can be described as a superposition, i.e.~total force is sum of all individual forces



			\paragraph{Third Law}
The third law is probably the hardest to grasp, but it has profound implications on how one should think about forces etc.~intuitively.

-> when I push table, I feel the force it exerts on me (not the one I exert)


mathematically speaking, it tells us something about symmetries of Newtonian dynamics (don't know how to elaborate further on that...)


\begin{ex}
	astronaut example who pushes stones away in space
\end{ex}


\begin{ex}[Momentum Conservation]
	A very interesting consequence of the third law arises when we remember how forces are related to momenta, i.e.~the second law. If we consider a physical system with no external forces acting on it, all forces acting are between the respective particles. The third law now implies that the total force, when looking at each pair of particles, must vanish since
	\begin{equation}
		\vec{F}_{ij} + \vec{F}_{ji} = \vec{F}_{ij} - \vec{F}_{ij} = 0
	\end{equation}
	where we use indices $i, j$ to refer to the $i$-th and $j$-th particle. Therefore, the total force when considering all particles also vanishes,
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:force_equilibrium}
		\eqbox{
			F_\mathrm{total}^k = \sum_{i, j} F_i^k = 0
		}
	\end{equation}
	where we denote by $\vec{F}_i$ the total force acting on particle $i$.

	In terms of the corresponding momenta, this implies
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:momentum_conservation}
		\eqbox{
			\sum_{i} \dv{p_i^k}{t} = 0
		} \, ,
	\end{equation}
	the total momentum of the system is constant. A common way to phrase this is saying the momentum is \Def[conservation]{conserved}.

	Exploiting this property alone is already enough to treat many physical problems. One example is the collision of two (or more) particles, where momentum conservation implies
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:implication_momentum_conservation}
		\sum_j p_j^k = \sum_j \tilde{p}_j^k \, .
	\end{equation}
	Here, $p_j^k$ denotes the momentum of the $j$-th object before the collision and $\tilde{p}_j^k$ after.

	-> this property is big reason why momenta are useful, despite their kind of abstract meaning
\end{ex}

As we have seen in this example, if there are no net external forces on a system, the total force vanishes (cf.~Eq.~\eqref{eq:force_equilibrium}). In particular, this characterizes the equilibrium of the system and is thus also a common way to determine how particles behave in such a system, given the forces between them. \todo{check wording here. because no external force does not always imply equilibrium, this is not what we are trying to say} -> point is: to determine how system in equilibrium looks like, we can analyze all forces acting on the system and demand that they cancel each other in the end (because then Newton 2 tells us momentum is conserved); this is frequently done to get relation between different forces in different physical situations



\iffalse
	\subsection{Accelerated Frames}
we need fictitious forces to describe stuff here, e.g.~Coriolis in rotating frames; this is why using them is inconvenient



		\subsection{Newton-Cartan Gravity}
can also formulate Newtonian description in other mathematical framework, fibre bundles and connections; is more in line with geometrical formulations brought forward by Einstein

-> do in next chapter? Here we don't do much geometry yet... And certainly no gravity

	\section{Relativity}
		\subsection{What Is Wrong with Newton?}
Newtonian theory works beautifully for many applications, even today where the theories of relativity and quantum mechanics are available. However, it does not describe the entirety of physics. This is also what physicists realized in the late $19$th/early $20$th century. At least to some degree, if not fully, every contradiction that surfaced at this time can be traced back to the nature of light.

In the 1860s, James Clerk Maxwell derived the \Def{Maxwell equations} describing electromagnetic fields. They predicted electromagnetic waves, whose existence was confirmed in 1886 in experiments conducted by Heinrich Hertz. These waves propagate with the speed of light,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:speed_of_light}
	\eqbox{
	c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_0 \, \mu_0}} = 299 \, 792 \, 458 \, \frac{\metre}{\second}
	} \, ,
\end{equation}
so it was (and still is) natural to identify them with light.


Several conflicts with Newtonian physics arise from this:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $c$ is constant for all observers measuring it. The Galilei transform describing transformations in Newtonian theory, however, predicts different speeds. More specifically, light emitted by a moving observer is measured to have a speed of $c + v$ by a resting observer.


	\item Maxwell's equations are not invariant under the Galilei transform. Instead, the corresponding symmetry transformations are modified versions of them (confer section \ref{sec:lorentz_transformation_1} on those Lorentz transformations).
\end{enumerate}

On the other hand, Newton's theory had tremendous success itself over many decades, so why would one conclude that this theory is at fault rather than the new Maxwell theory? Because (a) not all of Newtonian physics is to be replaced and (b) because of overwhelming experimental evidence. In addition to Hertz's experiments, the Michelson-Morley experiment in 1887 confirmed that $c$ is constant for all observers to high precision.\\


For this reason, some new concepts are needed. While one can handle the subject strictly mathematically and e.g.~simply derive the \enquote{correct} coordinate transformations that leave the Maxwell equations invariant, this tells us only little about the new physics that may arise. As we will learn, quite some rethinking of the concepts of space and time is needed to obtain equivalent results from a more intuitive approach and this work was mainly done by Einstein, e.g.~in his famous paper \enquote{On the electrodynamics of moving bodies} \cite{Einstein_1905}.



		\subsection{Einstein Postulates}
Einstein's theory is based on two fundamental ideas, which are formulated in postulates.

The first idea is to make the invariance under chosen reference frame, which has been known a long time beforehand, a building block of the theory rather than a consequence.
\begin{post}[Principle of Relativity]
	All physical observations must hold independently of the inertial frame that is chosen.
\end{post}
This principle can be traced back to Galileo Galilei, who formulated it in 1632. It means if you are in a closed room without any windows, you cannot perform any experiment to determine if you are at rest or moving at a constant velocity. In other words, there is no absolute notion of rest; it is all relative (hence the name \enquote{relativity principle}). Note how this fundamentally disagrees with Newton's concept of an absolute space, where something like a \enquote{master frame} exists.\todo{should we comment on how non-inertial frames can be found? pseudo-forces should be answer, right?}\\


-> I love simplicity of following sentence: it is impossible for scientists to set up an experiment that determines the velocity that the frame moves with (tells us already that absolute space is wrong as a concept)


The second postulate concerns the speed of light and is definitely something new.
\begin{post}[Universality of Speed of Light]\label{post:c_constant}
	The vacuum speed of light $c$ is constant for observers in all inertial frames.
\end{post}
Note that we do not demand \enquote{equivalent} statements like the relativity principle did -- $c$ has \emph{the exact same} value for all observers. This postulate was based on the insights mentioned in the previous subsection, i.e.~based on theory \emph{and} experiment, and even more experiment evidence has been collected since.

However, it has profound implications. One of them concerns the very notion of space itself. In Newtonian physics, the notion of space is an absolute one. This means there is one reference frame that describes \enquote{real} space and while frames moving with respect to this one exhibit the same physical observations, this frame always has a special role. One way to characterize this observer is by measuring the speed of light sent out by him. If it is $c$ and not differing by some amount, then the frame is at rest (otherwise it would be $c + v$).\footnote{Note that we can assume the value of $c$ to be known because it can be measured e.g.~using a mirror by measuring the round-trip time. Strictly speaking, this only yields the two-way speed of light, but details on inferring one-way speeds require theory we are yet to built up.} However, since all observers measure $c$ now, there is no way to determine this preferred observer at rest -- the notion of rest/motion and therefore the connected notion of space itself becomes completely relative. Albeit the relativity principle was known before him, Einstein was the first one to recognize all implications it has and that it ultimately leads to the abandonment of absolute space when combined with $c$ being constant.


At the same time, this constance makes $c$ very special because statements related to it are independent of the observer/inertial system and thus allow to make invariant statements. This property will be used routinely when properties in relativity are derived.\\



A direct corollary of postulate \ref{post:c_constant} is that $c$ is the maximum speed at which \emph{any} signal, not just light, can be transmitted.
% Taken from Dragon
\begin{prop}[Universal Speed Limit]%[Maximum Speed]
	The speed of light $c$ is the maximum velocity for all interactions.
\end{prop}
The proof of this is very similar to the argument provided beforehand.\footnote{The idea was taken from Dragon \cite{dragon_geometry_srt}, but I tried to provide more details. However, I am not 100\% sure about them being correct, so if you find an error to it, you might be right.}
\begin{proof}
	If there was a speed $c'$ higher than $c$, then for moving observers the speeds would be dependent on their velocity $v$ and observed to be $c' + v$. Consequently, one could single out an observer sending signals at $c'$ and this observer would be at rest -- a violation of the relativity principle.
	%(note: we can know the value of $c'$ by comparing the values of observers sent at the same speed $v$ in anti-parallel directions, giving us signal speeds $c' \pm v$)
\end{proof}

This implication is a reason why experimental tests of this speed limit are important, they are confirmations of postulate \ref{post:c_constant}. Such tests have been conducted successfully for neutrinos and gravitational waves, both of which do indeed propagate at the speed of light (to high experimental accuracy).\footnote{This also means confirmations of other theories, which introduce new fields to circumvent the relativity principle and still allow speeds $> c$, cannot be confirmed.} Interestingly, both the constancy of $c$ and it being the maximum speed attainable by any signal/information implies that relativistic addition $+_R$ must yield
\begin{equation}
	\eqbox{
	c +_R v = c
	}
\end{equation}
not matter the value of $v$. As we will see later, this statement is indeed true.



		\subsection{Light Cones \& Spacetime Diagrams}
Before we start to evaluate implications of these two postulates, it is customary to introduce a technique to visualize the time evolution of physical systems. The most straightforward choice is to map position $x$ on the $x$-axis and time $t$ on the $y$-axis, i.e.~a space-time diagram (which we will call \Def{spacetime diagram} instead, for reasons that will become clear later). Since we are often interested in velocities close to $c$, it is customary to rescale the time-axis and display $ct$-values instead of $t$-values on it (otherwise slopes would be very small, small time step would correspond to large change in position).

In doing that, we discard two of the three spatial dimensions of Euclidean space. Nonetheless, it is sufficient to visualize important ideas (see Fig.~\ref{fig:first_spacetime_diagram} for a simple example).
\begin{itemize}
	\item A single point in such a diagram gives position and time of an object (e.g.~particle, person or rocket). We will refer to these points as \Def{events} and use the symbol $E$.


	\item The trajectory of an object as a function of time (essentially a collection of events) is called \Def{world line} $\Gamma$. An example for $v = 0.5 c$ is shown as a red line in Fig.~\ref{fig:first_spacetime_diagram}.


	\item Light is described by the relation $x = ct$, which means it is always a diagonal at $\pm 45^\circ$ (corresponds to slope $\pm 1$), irrespective of the observer for which the diagram is drawn. This is why we often depict light sent out from and received by the origin (in both spatial directions), see the yellow lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:first_spacetime_diagram}.
\end{itemize}

For the first time, we encounter what is often called \Def{light cone structure} of relativity, which is essentially a corollary of $c$ being a universal speed limit. This fact shapes the causal structure in relativity and for spacetime diagrams, it tells us that only events connected by straight world lines with slope $\abs{v} \leq c$ can causally influence each other. This defines two cones above and below the event, the possible future and past of this event, each defined by events that the event can have interacted with or can potentially interact with. Together, these cones are called \Def{light cone} (see Fig.~\ref{fig:first_spacetime_diagram} for an example). In terms of light cones, the structure of relativity can be states as follows.
\begin{defi}[Timelike, Lightlike, Spacelike]\label{defi:causality_v1}
	A straight world line $\Gamma$ connecting events $E_1, E_2$ is called
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \Def{timelike}, if it lies inside of $E_1$'s and $E_2$'s light cone ($\abs{v} < c$)
		
		
		\item \Def{null/lightlike}, if it lies on the edge of $E_1$'s and $E_2$'s light cone ($\abs{v} = c$)
		
		
		\item \Def{spacelike}, if it lies outside of $E_1$'s and $E_2$'s light cone ($\abs{v} > c$)
	\end{itemize}
\end{defi}
Accordingly, the events $E_1, E_2$ are called timelike-separated, null-/lightlike-separated and spacelike-separated.

	\section{Clocks}\label{sec:clocks}
%{Time Measurement} % Sounds kind of awkward
% Nice inctroduction from previous subsection, but not needed anymore I think: we want equivalent results in all frames; if we try to measure a distance, this requires a notion of \enquote{at the same time}; harder than it sounds (communication cannot happen instantaneously, as we have just learned), but this is why we will deal with measuring time now, i.e.~clocks -> maybe put into introduction of clocks
Until now, we have not really discussed the notion of time. Partly, this is because we natively have a very clear, intuitive understanding of it: we look at clocks to measure it and this notion can be employed anywhere in space -- just use equal clocks in different points and compare their readings. This definition is employed in Newtonian physics, without much more attention being needed -- Newtonian physics assumes the existence of \Def{absolute time}.\footnote{This is also reflected in the fact that the Galilei transform as the appropriate frame transformation keeps the time fixed, $t' = t$.} However, as is the story for much of relativity theory, this notion essentially breaks down once we go to more extreme situations like distances on cosmic scales or clocks moving relative to each other with high velocities. In both of those cases, timing the reading of a clock and hence comparing if they show the same time is difficult. For large distances, this is rather easy to see because information is transmitted at a finite speed $\leq c$, so when receiving information about the measurement result $t$ of a far-away clock, we have to take into account the time it traveled to us in order to find out which event happened simultaneously to $t$.

This is problematic since many notions implicitly rely on the fact that we can measure quantities at the same time, i.e.~on a notion of simultaneity. A very important example are lengths, which are defined as the separation of points -- at a fixed time. Therefore, a well-defined notion of \enquote{at a fixed time} is required for us to be able to measure lengths and until now, we have no such notion. In everyday life, it is easy to avoid such difficulties: after all, we can look at clocks side-by-side, make sure they show the same time and then move one of them away to the desired position. This procedure ensures the clocks are synchronized, so we can simply take the desired measurements and compare the times later on. However, this is not really feasible to do that for measurements between planets or galaxies and clearly, an alternative, perhaps more general, way of communicating time measurements is needed.


All of that motivates the need for a synchronization procedure of clocks. We will here discuss the one proposed by Einstein, starting with its definition for resting observers and then look at it for the case of moving observers. Throughout this section, we will adopt visualizations from \cite{dragon_geometry_srt}, while many of the definitions follow \cite{giulini_srt} more closely.

		\subsection{Synchrony of Clocks}
			\paragraph{Resting Observers}
Our setting is identical copies of an ideal clock being attached to each point in space (Fig.~\ref{fig:unsynchr_synchr_clocks}). For a consistent, well-defined notion of \enquote{global time}, however, we have to make sure these clocks show equivalent times. To do that, we will synchronize them by adopting the following definition, originally proposed by Einstein in \cite{Einstein_1905}.

\begin{defi}[Einstein Synchronization]\label{defi:einstein_synchrony}
	%Two clocks $\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{C}'$ with times $t, t'$ attached to observers $\mathcal{O}, \mathcal{O}'$ are \Def{synchronized}/\Def{equal} if they show the same times to their referee $\mathcal{R}$, i.e.~$t = t'$.
	%Two clocks $\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{C}'$ with times $t, t'$ attached to observers $\mathcal{O}, \mathcal{O}'$ at rest are \Def{synchronized}, i.e.~$t = t'$, if light signals sent out from them meet exactly in the midpoint of $\overline{\mathcal{O} \mathcal{O}'}$.
	%
	% I think following ones are better (they are equivalent, choice is just made because of better pedagogical way of introducing)
	%Two clocks $\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{C}'$ with readings $t, t'$ attached to observers $\mathcal{O}, \mathcal{O}'$ at rest (relative to each other) are \Def{synchronized} if light signals sent out from them at the same reading of their respective clocks meet exactly in the midpoint of $\overline{\mathcal{O} \mathcal{O}'}$.
	Two clocks $\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{C}'$ with readings $t, t'$ attached to observers $\mathcal{O}, \mathcal{O}'$ at rest (relative to each other) are \Def{synchronized} if light signals sent out from them travel the same time on $\overline{\mathcal{O} \mathcal{O}'}$ as they do on $\overline{\mathcal{O}' \mathcal{O}}$.
\end{defi}

More explicitly, consider the following scenario: $\mathcal{O}$ sends out light with his clock $\mathcal{C}$ showing the time $t_+$, $\mathcal{O}'$ reads the time $t'$ off of his clock $\mathcal{C}'$ upon arrival of this light, immediately reflecting it back to $\mathcal{O}$ (along with the information that $t'$ was measured) who receives it with his clock $\mathcal{C}$ showing $t_-$. Then $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{C}'$ are said to be synchronized if
\begin{equation}\label{eq:synchr_explicit}
	t' - t_- = t_+ - t'
	\quad \Leftrightarrow \quad
	\eqbox{
	t' = \frac{t_+ + t_-}{2}
	}
	\, .
\end{equation}
If $\mathcal{C}'$ were to show a different time, then in order to synchronize it with $\mathcal{C}$ we would \emph{set}
%\footnote{This freedom in synchronization procedure exists because a single clock can only measure the two-way speed of light, which is $c$. The Einstein synchronization then sets time so that the one-way speed of light is $c$ as well. See \cite{Minguzzi_2003} for details and a proof. \cite{giulini_srt} also elaborates on this topic in section 2.1.}
one of the clocks so that Eq.~\eqref{eq:synchr_explicit} holds.
%\footnote{Essentially, the definition assumes that the value $t'$ is communicated to $\mathcal{O}$ in some way, without bothering about the details of a practical implementation of this.} 
 An eventual asynchrony would be measurable since an offset $t' \rightarrow t' + \Delta t$ of $\mathcal{C}'$ compared to $\mathcal{C}$ would lead to
\begin{equation}\label{eq:synchr_offset}
	(t' + \Delta t) - t_- = t_+ - (t' + \Delta t)
	\quad \Leftrightarrow \quad
	t' = \frac{t_+ + t_-}{2} - \Delta t \, ,
\end{equation}
i.e.~by comparing $t'$ (which we assume to be reported to $\mathcal{O}$, without bothering about the details of a practical implementation of this report) to $\frac{t_+ + t_-}{2}$, we can check if $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{C}'$ are synchronized. In principle, this confirmation of synchrony has to be done just once because synchronized clocks of observers which are at rest relative to each other remain synchronized for all times (assuming ideal, identical clocks). Visually speaking (thus referring to Fig.~\ref{fig:clocks_at_rest_wrt_each_other} (a), (b), for example), that is because changing the times involved only shift the whole setup of light signals parallel to the observers world lines, but do not change their relations (length, intersections, etc.). In particular, the clocks $\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{C}$ attached to $\mathcal{O}, \mathcal{O}'$ remain synchronized.


An important aspect of the scheme we present here is to realize that the freedom to \emph{set} $t'$ according to Eq.~\eqref{eq:synchr_explicit} does actually exist. The reason is that using a single clock $\mathcal{C}$ showing time $t$, only the two-way speed of light (i.e.~$c$) as an average speed of the roundtrip $\overline{\mathcal{O} \mathcal{O}' \mathcal{O}}$ can be measured. Therefore, 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:two_way_light_speed}
	\eqbox{
	c (t_+ - t_-) = \overline{\mathcal{O} \mathcal{O}' \mathcal{O}} = 2 \, \overline{\mathcal{O} \mathcal{O}'}
	} \, .
\end{equation}
The Einstein synchronization of $\mathcal{C}$ then utilizes a second clock with time $t'$ to makes sure that $t' - t_- = t_+ - t'$, which implies
\begin{equation}\label{eq:one_way_light_speed}
	 c (t_+ - t_-) = c (t_+ - t') + c (t_- - t') = 2 \, \overline{\mathcal{O} \mathcal{O}'}
	\quad \Leftrightarrow \quad
	\eqbox{
	t' - t_- = \frac{\overline{\mathcal{O} \mathcal{O}'}}{c} = t_+ - t'
	} \, ,
\end{equation}
which means the one-way speeds on both paths are also $c$.\footnote{See \cite{Minguzzi_2003} for more details. \cite{giulini_srt} also elaborates on this topic in section 2.1.}


This notion of synchrony gives rise to the following notion of simultaneity.
\begin{defi}[Simultaneity]\label{defi:simultaneity}
	%The corresponding events $E$ at $t$ and $E'$ at $t'$ are then said to be \Def{simultaneous}. % When it was in definition of synchronization
	%Two events $E$ at $t$ and $E'$ at $t'$ are called \Def{simultaneous} if the locally simultaneous clock readings of synchronized clocks at these events are identical.%, i.e.~$t = t'$. % Not sure about last part, maybe it is good to be less explicit here
	%
	% Now for new definition of synchrony
	Two events $E$ at $t$ and $E'$ at $t'$ are called \Def[event!simultaneous]{simultaneous} (also: \Def[event!reciprocal]{reciprocal}) if the locally simultaneous clock readings of synchronized clocks $\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{C}'$ at these events are identical, i.e.~$t = t'$.
\end{defi}

Now we are able to answer the question which time $\mathcal{C}$ shows when the light signal sent out from $\mathcal{O}$ at $t_-$ is reflected by $\mathcal{O}'$ (at $t'$). It is precisely
\begin{equation}\label{eq:simult_explicit}
	\eqbox{
	t = t' = \frac{t_+ + t_-}{2}
	} \, .
\end{equation}
Therefore, $\mathcal{O}$ can infer the time $t'$ at which the event $E'$ occurred using only readings $t_-, t_+$ of $\mathcal{C}$ (which reflects the \enquote{locally simultaneous} part), a crucial property to have, remembering the introduction of this section. After all, we know that for synchronized clocks $\mathcal{C}'$ showed $t'$, so the event $E$ where $\mathcal{C}$ shows $t$ must occur at the same time as (i.e.~be simultaneous to) $E'$. Of course, the synchronization is mutual, i.e.~the time $t$ as seen by light sent out and received from $\mathcal{O}'$ is
\begin{equation}
	\eqbox{
	t = \frac{t'_+ + t'_-}{2}
	}
\end{equation}
holds as well (another way to see this is that $t = t' \Rightarrow t_+ = t'_+$ and $t_- = t'_-$).

In addition to the mutuality $\equiv$ symmetry, synchronization (or, equivalently, the induced notion of simultaneity) has some other properties, which can be proven mostly by logic.
\begin{prop}[Simultaneity as an Equivalence Relation]\label{prop:simult_equiv_relation}
	Simultaneity defines an equivalence relation on the set of all events in an inertial frame, i.e.~the following properties hold:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Reflexivity: every event is simultaneous to itself.
		
		\item Symmetry: if $E$ is simultaneous to $E'$, then $E'$ is simultaneous to $E$.
		
		\item Transitivity: if $E$ is simultaneous to $E'$ and $E'$ is simultaneous to $E''$, then $E$ is simultaneous to $E''$.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	Moreover, a family of synchronized clocks partitions the set of all events $\{E\}$ into several, mutually disjoint subsets (equivalence classes) containing events which are simultaneous to each other.
\end{prop}
A key takeaway is the following: events that simultaneous for one observer $\mathcal{O}$ are simultaneous for every other observer $\mathcal{O}'$ at rest relative to $\mathcal{O}$. It is very important to stress the \enquote{at rest} part here, synchrony of clocks and thus simultaneity of events are tied to specific inertial systems. In particular, other inertial systems may and will define synchrony and simultaneity differently (for the same set of events). We will look at the consequences of that later in this section. For now, though, we focus on an implication of the transitivity. This property allows the following, equivalent definition of clock synchronization (in some sense another characterization of Einstein synchronization).
%The synchronization procedure specified here is by no means the only possible choice. An equivalent definition would be the following.
\begin{defi}[Einstein Synchronization 2]\label{defi:synchrony_2}
	Two clocks $\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{C}'$ with readings $t, t'$ attached to observers $\mathcal{O}, \mathcal{O}'$ at rest (relative to each other) are \Def{synchronized} if light signals sent out from them at the same reading of their respective clocks meet exactly in the midpoint of $\overline{\mathcal{O} \mathcal{O}'}$.
\end{defi}
This is clearly equivalent to equality of total travel time $\overline{\mathcal{O} \mathcal{O}' \mathcal{O}} = 2 \, \overline{\mathcal{O} \mathcal{O}'}$ as demanded in \ref{defi:einstein_synchrony}, but stating it in this way has one advantage (which is where the transitivity from property \ref{prop:simult_equiv_relation} is utilized): two clocks $\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{C}'$ attached to observers $\mathcal{O}, \mathcal{O}'$ are synchronous if they show equal times to the observer that is exactly between them. This is meant in the sense that light signals sent out from $\mathcal{R}$ take the same time to go to $\mathcal{O}$ and come back as they do to go to $\mathcal{O}'$ and come back. In accordance with \cite{dragon_geometry_srt}, we will refer to this third observer as \Def{referee} $\mathcal{R}$. Just like synchrony, simultaneity can be defined in terms of $\mathcal{R}$ as well.
\begin{defi}[Simultaneity 2]
	Two events $E$ at $t$ and $E'$ at $t'$ are called \Def{simultaneous} if light sent out at the same time from the referee $\mathcal{R}$ arrives $\mathcal{O}$ at $E$ and $\mathcal{O}'$ at $t'$.
\end{defi}
Hence, instead of tuning $t'$ such that no $\Delta t$ occurs (as it was used in Eq.~\eqref{eq:synchr_offset}), we now argue via light signals sent out from $\mathcal{R}$ to $\mathcal{O}, \mathcal{O}'$ at time $t^R_-$. $t^R$ is time measured by a clock $\mathcal{C}^R$ attached to $\mathcal{R}$. By definition, the reflected signals come back to $\mathcal{R}$ at the same time $t^R_+$. If the times $t, t'$ at which the light has been reflected by $\mathcal{O}, \mathcal{O}'$ fulfil
\begin{equation}\label{eq:synchr_referee}
	t = t' = t^R = \frac{t^R_+ + t^R_-}{2} \, ,
\end{equation}
then the clocks $\mathcal{C}^R, \mathcal{C}, \mathcal{C}'$ are synchronized. By prolonging the beams sent out from and received by $\mathcal{R}$ (which form what is sometimes called a \Def{lightangle}), one can then obtain the times $t_-, t_+, t'_-, t'_+$ and also the same light signal paths that the previous definition \ref{defi:einstein_synchrony} yielded. This situation is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:clocks_at_rest_wrt_each_other} (a).

			\paragraph{Resting Observers from a Different Frame}
We have already mentioned how the Einstein synchronization is not unique. However, this scheme has one big advantage: it respects the relativity principle, as Fig.~\ref{fig:clocks_at_rest_wrt_each_other} (b) illustrates. The idea is to analyze the situation from Fig.~\ref{fig:clocks_at_rest_wrt_each_other} (a) in a different inertial frame that is moving relative to both observers (which stay at rest relative to each other).\footnote{For a better distinction between these situations, the observers are named $\mathcal{O}'', \mathcal{O}'''$ instead of $\mathcal{O}, \mathcal{O}'$. This does not change any interpretations that were mentioned.} Indeed, by constructing the referee $\mathcal{R}'$ and drawing the light signals sent to and from each observer (which form a lightangle again), one obtains the times $t''_-, t''_+, t'''_-, t'''_+$ by prolonging the edges of the lightangle. This is equivalent to what has been done for resting observers in Fig.~\ref{fig:clocks_at_rest_wrt_each_other} (a) and likewise,
\begin{equation}
	t'' = \frac{t''_+ + t''_2}{2}
	\manyqquad
	t''' = \frac{t'''_+ + t'''_-}{2}
	\, .
\end{equation}
Therefore, the observers $\mathcal{O}'', \mathcal{O}'''$ agree on $t'' = t'''$ (to verify that, we can also look at the distance of $t_-, t, t_+$ on the vertical axis we use to depict time or the distance along the world lines of the observers).

But nonetheless, something seems to be different. We get an idea of what it might be from a comparison of the pairs of synchronized clocks in Fig.~\ref{fig:clocks_at_rest_wrt_each_other} (c), where  $t = t''$ has been assumed in the event where $\mathcal{O}, \mathcal{O}''$ intersect for a simpler discussion. While both pairs of clocks are synchronized among themselves, the induced notion of simultaneity for $\mathcal{C}'', \mathcal{C}'''$ is \emph{not} the same as the one for $\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{C}'$. We can see that from $t'''$ being higher than $t'$ on the time axes of both the resting and moving observers (which are parallel to their world lines). Geometrically speaking, the \enquote{lines of simultaneity} (diagonal from left to right corner in lightangle) change from being horizontal in Fig.~\ref{fig:clocks_at_rest_wrt_each_other} (a) to being tilted in (b).\\


The origin of these differences lies in the change of inertial frame. While light has the same world line as before due to the constancy of $c$, the world lines of both clocks, $\mathcal{O}''$ and $\mathcal{O}'''$, are tilted now (which causes the observed change in the lightangle). Therefore, the time of flight for light on $\overline{\mathcal{O}'' \mathcal{O}'''}$ is different from the one on $\overline{\mathcal{O}''' \mathcal{O}''}$ (equivalent: time needed for $\overline{\mathcal{O}'' \mathcal{R}'}$ differs from the one for $\overline{\mathcal{O}''' \mathcal{R}'}$) because the observers are moving uniformly in the same direction. More explicitly, while the one-way speeds of light are still $c$ for both paths, the uniform motion of both clocks leads to differences $v (t''' - t''_-), -v (t''_+ - t''')$ in separation $\overline{\mathcal{O}'' \mathcal{O}'''}$ and thus (from the perspective of an observer that is resting in this frame, such as $\mathcal{O}$)
\begin{equation}\label{eq:one_way_light_speed_v2}
	\eqbox{
	c (t''' - t''_-) = \overline{\mathcal{O}'' \mathcal{O}'''} + v (t''' - t''_-)
	}
	\quad \text{ and } \quad
	\eqbox{
	c (t''_+ - t''') = \overline{\mathcal{O}'' \mathcal{O}'''} - v (t''_+ - t''')
	} \, .
\end{equation}
Consequently,
\begin{align}
	\eqbox{
	t''' - t''_- = \frac{\overline{\mathcal{O}'' \mathcal{O}'''}}{c - v} \neq \frac{\overline{\mathcal{O}''' \mathcal{O}''}}{c + v} = t''_+ - t'''
	}
	%\quad \text{ and } \quad
	\; , \;
	\eqbox{
	t'' - t'''_- = \frac{\overline{\mathcal{O}''' \mathcal{O}''}}{c + v} \neq \frac{\overline{\mathcal{O}'' \mathcal{O}'''}}{c - v} = t'''_+ - t''
	} \, ,
\end{align}
in contrast to Eq.~\eqref{eq:one_way_light_speed} -- the one-way speeds as seen from a stationary observer in Fig.~\ref{fig:clocks_at_rest_wrt_each_other} (b) is \emph{not} $c$, the clocks are not seen to by synchronized (\enquote{$t'''$ is higher on the time axis as $t'$}).



			\paragraph{Moving Observers}
As we have already mentioned and also demonstrated, the Einstein synchronization does respect the relativity principle, which means it can be applied to clocks resting relative to each other in arbitrary inertial frames. However, just like different inertial observers can disagree on the speed of an object, that does not mean synchronized clocks in different inertial frames make equivalent statements, e.g.~regarding the simultaneity of events. Using Fig.~\ref{fig:clocks_at_rest_wrt_each_other} (c), we made a first try to visualize this and also started discussing it at the end of the last paragraph. Now, we shall complete this discussion by examining the relation of clocks moving relative to one another in more detail. For clocks which have been synchronized at some point in time, which we choose to be $t = 0 = t'$ (any time smaller than $\tau = \tau'$ would work equally well), the following theorem holds.
\begin{thm}[Minkowski's Theorem]\label{thm:minkowski_moving_clocks}
	For two observers $\mathcal{O}, \mathcal{O}'$ that move relative to each other with velocity $v$ and an event $E'$ occurring on the world line of $\mathcal{O}'$ at time $\tau'$,
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:minkowski_theorem}
		\eqbox{
		\tau' = \sqrt{t_+ t_-} = \sqrt{1 - v^2 / c^2} \, t = t - \qty(1 - \sqrt{1 - v^2 / c^2}) \, t
		} \, .
	\end{equation}
	Here, $t_-, t_+$ are the times measured by a clock $\mathcal{C}$ on $\mathcal{O}$ when light signals to $E'$ have been sent out and received back, and $t = (t_- + t_+) / 2$.
\end{thm}
% 
\begin{proof}
	% is inspired by \cite{Tonkinson_2009} (but perhaps also Dragon)
	
	
	% time travel time between spatially distant observers at rest with respect to each other are constant at all times; for relatively translating frames, time travel time also depends on time of emission, though it is also prolonged by same factor \todo{is this correct phrasing? Point is that factor only depends on $v$, so arrival time = doppler * emission time where doppler = doppler(v) = const}
	
	% -> so, we now have tau = t+ * t-; but how can we relate it to velocity? For that, we need an expression for the Doppler factor!
	
	% \todo{remember to show cool form of Doppler from \cite{Tonkinson_2009} only in dedicated section on this}
	
	
	% we now adopt perspective of unprimed observer: then we have tau = doppler(v) * t- and t+ = doppler(v) * tau. Because at both points the relative velocity is v.
	
	% lines of simultaneity tilt for this reason in Fig.~\ref{fig:moving_clocks}
	
	
	In this proof, we will use the terminology from the setup in Fig.~\ref{fig:moving_clocks} (c).
	
	We had seen before that the light travel time between spatially distant observers at rest with respect to each other are constant at all times (cf.~Fig.~\ref{fig:clocks_at_rest_wrt_each_other}), no matter if they are viewed from a frame at rest with respect to the these observes (Fig.~\ref{fig:clocks_at_rest_wrt_each_other} (a)) or from a frame that moves with respect to them (Fig.~\ref{fig:clocks_at_rest_wrt_each_other}). More specifically,
	\begin{equation}
		t_r - t_e = \overline{\mathcal{O} \mathcal{O}'} / c
	\end{equation}
	where $t_e$ is the time of emission and $t_r$ the time of reception of a signal.
	
	For relatively translating frames, on the other hand, the light travel also depends on the time of emission. If the two frames are uniformly moving with respect to each other, then the relation between time of emission and time of reception becomes
	\begin{equation}
		t_r = \kappa t_e
	\end{equation}
	with a factor $\kappa = \kappa(v)$ that does not depend explicitly on $t_e$. As \cite{dragon_geometry_srt} argues, this can be inferred from basic geometrical properties of two sets of triangles for different times of emission, e.g., $\overline{0 \, t_- \, \tau'}, \overline{0 \, \tau \, t'_+}$ (here we use $0$ to denote the origin, where all observers were in the same spatial location and the respective clocks were synchronized).
	
	Since the clocks carried by $\mathcal{O}, \mathcal{O}'$ have been synchronized initially, we can write
	\begin{equation}
		t'_F = \kappa t_A, \; t_B = \kappa t'_F \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \frac{t'_F}{t_A} = \kappa = \frac{t_B}{t'_F} \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad t'_F = \sqrt{t_A t_B}
	\end{equation}
	This is the first part of we wanted to prove. But we still need an expression for $\kappa$. In order to get it, we use that the reading assigned by the clock $\mathcal{C}$ of $\mathcal{O}$ to event $F$ is
	\begin{equation}
		t_F = \frac{t_B + t_A}{2} = \frac{\kappa t'_F + t_A}{2} = \frac{\kappa^2 + 1}{2} t_A \, .
	\end{equation}

	We will now compare the travel times of $\mathcal{O}'$ and light sent from $A$, which meet in the same location at event $F$. Analyzing the situation from the perspective of $\mathcal{O}$, this implies
	\begin{align}
		& \quad c (t_F - t_A) = v (t_F - 0)
		\notag\\
		\Leftrightarrow & \quad c \frac{\kappa^2 + 1}{2} t_A - c t_A = v \frac{\kappa^2 + 1}{2} t_A
		\notag\\
		%\Leftrightarrow & \quad (\kappa^2 - 1) = v (1 + \kappa^2)
		%\notag\\
		%\Leftrightarrow & \quad \kappa^2 = 1 + \frac{v}{c} (1 + \kappa^2)
		%\notag\\
		%\Leftrightarrow & \quad \kappa^2 (1 + \frac{v}{c}) = 1 + \frac{v}{c}
		%
		\dots & \quad \text{(some algebra)}
		\notag\\
		\Leftrightarrow & \quad \kappa = \sqrt{\frac{1 + v / c}{1 - v / c}} = \frac{1 + v / c}{\sqrt{1 - v^2 / c^2}} \, .
		\label{eq:doppler_derivation}
	\end{align}
	This factor $\kappa$ is of interest in itself, but for us it is just a helper tool at this point. Cf.~Sec.~\ref{subsec:doppler} for more details on this \Def{Doppler factor}.

	Since we have selected three pairs of reciprocal events, $A \leftrightarrow C, B \leftrightarrow D, E \leftrightarrow F$, their times fulfill $t_A = t'_C, t_E = t'_F, t_B = t'_D$. But what is the relation of, e.g., $t_F, t'_F$? To obtain this, we rewrite
	\begin{equation}
		t_F = \frac{t_B + t_A}{2} = \frac{\kappa t'_F + t'_F / \kappa}{2} = [\kappa(v) + \kappa(-v)] \frac{t'_F}{2} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{1 - v^2 / c^2}} \frac{t'_F}{2} \, .
	\end{equation}
	This is nothing but Eq.~\eqref{eq:minkowski_theorem}.
	% 
	% -> we do NOT get $t_F = t'_F$ anymore, this is reflection of not simultaneous!!!
\end{proof}
This is a geometrical proof, which was taken more or less from \cite{dragon_geometry_srt}. Einstein's original derivation was different and an analogous version for that is presented in Sec.~\ref{subsec:time_dilation_lorentz}.


% -> Fig.~\ref{fig:moving_clocks} (a) shows that the moving clocks still run at same rate from perspective of the resting observer. But what if we look at two observers that move with $\abs{v_1} = \abs{v_2}$?


\todo{check that all statements regarding referee are correct. Yes, does desynchronize as well, but can still serve as referee, meaning it lies at intersections of lightangles}


But what does this result actually mean? It probably looks very puzzling at first, so let us elaborate on it, starting with the viewpoint of $\mathcal{O}$ (for the accompanying illustrations, see Fig.~\ref{fig:moving_clocks}). Because the clocks have been synchronized in the beginning, $\mathcal{O}$ expects that the light signals sent out and received at $t_-, t_+$ saw $\mathcal{O}'$ when $\mathcal{C}'$ showed
\begin{equation*}
	t = \frac{t_+ + t_-}{2}
\end{equation*}
the time a clock synchronized with $\mathcal{C}$, i.e.~at rest relative to it, would show. However, the time that $\mathcal{C}'$ really showed is given by Minkowski's theorem as
\begin{equation*}
	\tau' = \sqrt{1 - v^2 / c^2} \, t = t - (1 - \sqrt{1 - v^2 / c^2}) t \, .
\end{equation*}
This is the same time $\tau$ that $\mathcal{C}$ has shown a bit earlier, $\tau = \tau' < t$ (for $v > 0$), the moving clock is slow by $1 - \sqrt{1 - v^2 / c^2}$ seconds per second. Accordingly, $\mathcal{C}'$ expects $\mathcal{C}$ to show that
\begin{equation*}
	t' = \frac{t'_+ + t'_-}{2}
\end{equation*}
has passed when light sent out from $\mathcal{O}'$ at $t'_-$ arrives there. Instead though, $\mathcal{C}$ shows
\begin{equation*}
	\tau = \sqrt{1 - v^2 / c^2} \, t' \, ,
\end{equation*}
which is equal to the time $\tau' < t'$ that $\mathcal{C}'$ has shown before. At first sight, this makes the result even more puzzling and in fact seems paradoxical -- how can both observers claim less time has passed for the other one?


Well, actually, thinking about previous results of relativity, this result should not surprise us at all: both observers can claim the other one moves while they are stationary (a manifestation of the relativity principle). Therefore, they can also both claim that the other clock moves and records smaller time intervals than their own, resting clock. What is safe to say, though, is that observers moving relative to each other have no common notion of simultaneity. In fact, there is no absolute notion of simultaneity anymore (in some sense, this is a direct consequence of the absence of an absolute notion of being stationary). 

This is no contradiction to the previous findings we had, one can rather adopt the viewpoint that Minkowski's theorem gives us the most general way of comparing times between clocks in different inertial systems. After all, for observers with relative velocity $v = 0$, the geometric mean $\sqrt{t_+ t_-}$ reduces back to the arithmetic mean $\frac{t_+ + t_-}{2}$, yielding the familiar result
\begin{equation}
	t = \frac{t_+ + t_-}{2} = \tau = \tau' = \frac{t'_+ + t'_-}{2} = t' \, .
\end{equation}

The question that truly matters now is the following: is this a physical effect? I.e.~do moving observers really experience less time going by? Or is this just an effect induced by our notion of simultaneity, which does not work for observers that move relative to each other?


% -> we will show later that effect persists even if we do not compare clocks at a distance

% Nonetheless, all observers will agree on physically relevant statements like the order of events ($t_1 < t_2 \; \Leftrightarrow \; \tau_1 < \tau_2$; causality is still intact).

Also, it does not matter which rest frame because the effect is mutual, i.e.~it does not change if we replace $v \rightarrow -v$.

One final note, before we answer this question, concerns some related vocabulary. It is commonly said that \enquote{moving clocks run slowly}, perhaps also in this document. However, one has to be careful taking this too literally: we are looking at \emph{identical} clocks here, i.e.~if we were to compare them side-by-side, the rate of \emph{all} clocks we have dealt with would be perfectly equal. It is just that their readings are different for the same event if measured from different inertial frames (which is, admittedly, a very subtle difference). This is supported by the fact that more than two clocks are needed to see mutuality of effect, at least one resting and one moving pair is required (so that synchronization is possible). See \cite{giulini_srt} for a more detailed discussion.


% \todo{well, it is not even that one clock runs slowly. It is just that notion of simultaneity is not compatible anymore! Similarly to twin paradox that we analyze later, different readings of co-located clocks after some movement requires change of reference system! In fact, this is exactly what we do in twin paradox discussion!}


% -> ok, I get why Giulini is careful about \enquote{moving clocks tick slower} at this point: mutuality of effect comes from the fact that they are in different reference frames, so all we can infer is that they cannot agree on which events are simultaneous; moreover, inferring this takes more than two clocks, as Giulini argues and as we can also see in Fig.~\ref{fig:clocks_at_rest_wrt_each_other} (c); only becomes meaningful for twin paradox case, where clocks are same reference frame at beginning and end because only then we can synchronize clocks again there or rather see if they are still synchronized, assuming this was done in beginning (because in rest frame we are sure it works) -> the \enquote{only meaningful} part is not really true, is also meaningful when we only have two observers that move relative to each other; but is a good sanity check





		\subsection{Time Dilation}
In principle, there is no unique procedure to synchronize clocks. Admittedly, the Einstein synchronization does have a few very convenient properties, like respecting the relativity principle (which is achieved by exploiting the constancy of $c$ again). However, it produces strange results for observers moving relative to each other, namely that less time passes on moving clocks (something we do not know from our everyday life). Therefore, it is a valid question to ask whether or not this is an effect induced by our specific choice of synchrony, i.e.~if other procedures could build consistent notions of global time free of these effects. In other words: is this a bug or a feature of time?


Not surprisingly, though, the answer is that we have discovered a fundamental \emph{feature} of time, which is uncovered by and not caused by the Einstein synchronization. Time does indeed slow down for moving observer, an effect called \Def{time dilation}. The implications of this are profound: In relativity, the idea of a universally agreed upon absolute time has to be abandoned. Instead, it becomes relative and depends on the motional state of the observer that measures it. Of course, if the time standard becomes relative, so do notions like simultaneity. As a consequence, both observers have the right to claim less time went by for the other and both are right in doing so. This is a key fact to understand relativity and no different from the abandonment of absolute space, which had analogous implications on observers moving uniformly relative to each other. Here, both can claim to be at rest, while the other one moves because it does not change the physics exhibited by the situation. The same is true for times (although it might not be clear yet). Put differently, just like the answer to \enquote{where does event $E$ happen?} depends on the coordinates we choose, the answer to \enquote{at which time did event $E$ happen?} depends on the (world line of the) clock we use in our measurements.

%\rem{argument 1 why is correct (not sure if this is good argument): we have derived from first principles, why not, only from principles of relativity, so if we assume them to be true (also, physically relevant statements like on causality of events still work in correct way); 2: effect persists even if we compare clocks that have moved in the same location, is not issue of comparing clocks at varying distances; 3: clock transport is equivalent to Einstein synchronization, so our intuitive notion of how to compare times will actually yield same results if we use it to analyze situations as before! We just never see it in everyday-life; 4, the ultimate argument: experimental evidence shows it (mention Hafele-Keating experiment)}



Not surprisingly, though, the answer is that we have discovered a fundamental \emph{feature} of time, which is uncovered by and not caused by the Einstein synchronization. Time does indeed slow down for moving observer, an effect called \Def{time dilation}. The implications of this are profound: in relativity, the notion of an absolute, universal time, that all observers agree on, has to be abandoned. In fact, as we have seen, not even all inertial observers can agree on such a common time standard that holds good for all times, they de-synchronize if moved with respect to each other. Instead, time becomes relative and depends on the motional state of the observer that measures it. Of course, if the time standard becomes relative, so do notions like simultaneity. As a consequence, both observers have the right to claim less time went by for the other and both are right in doing so. This is a key fact to understand relativity and no different from the abandonment of absolute space, which had analogous implications on observers moving uniformly relative to each other.

%\todo{mention later how clocks actually measure spacetime, not just time; so for observer that is moving spatially, this makes it natural that time shown by a clock he carries must change accordingly; is also reflected in Minkowski metric}


An argument that even further supports choosing the Einstein synchronization is equivalent to the synchronization via \Def{clock transport}. Here, one sets the same time on clocks which are right next to each other and then moves one of these clocks (sometimes called master clock) to different points in space so that other the readings of other clocks can be compared to this master clock (in a slow transport limit, such that negligible time dilation occurs on the way; Giulini discusses this explicitly in Sec.~5.1 of \cite{giulini_srt}). This is what we would do intuitively to synchronize clocks on Earth, and the fact that Einstein synchronization is equivalent to it strengthens our confidence in the findings. The Newtonian way of describing time as an absolute, universal notion has only survived for so long because for velocities $v$ that are not somewhat close to $c$, we have $\sqrt{1 - v^2 / c^2} \approx 1$ and $\tau \approx t$. This also shows that our unfamiliarity with time dilation comes from our lack of experience with velocities $v \approx c$ and large/cosmic distances rather than pointing to some mistake in the results.\\


Our next goal is to resolve the seemingly paradoxical mutuality of time dilation. One might suspect that the de-synchronization of clocks is caused by changes in the travel time as $\mathcal{O}$ and $\mathcal{O}'$ move farther away from each other, i.e.~by the increasing spatial separation leading to difficulties in communication between them and thus confusing the synchronization. Albeit it is true that the separation does increase, the de-synchronization arising from this is not a technical issue of the procedure. We can convince ourselves of this by looking at a scenario where the clock readings are compared in immediate spatial vicinity. It is commonly stated in the following form.
\begin{ex}[Twin Paradox]\label{ex:twin_paradox_1}
	It deals with two observers (commonly taken to be twins, i.e.~of the same age), one of them at rest and the other one moving uniformly to some destination, for example Mars $M$. Both start at the same time and at the same point in space and meet again in this point at some later time. The interesting question is how much time has passed for both of them, after all we have just learned that uniform motion affects clocks. In reality, this experiment would involve some kind of acceleration (turning around), but as Dragon points out in \cite{dragon_geometry_srt} this would not change the results because one can accelerate the resting observer in this time as well. Hence, any result we infer from instantaneous accelerations (and uniform movement in between) already contains the relevant ingredients and can be attributed to uniform motion. It should also be noted that certainly no general relativity is needed to explain the effects (as long as any effect of gravity is neglected), contrary to what is claimed in many popular-science explanations. This statement is correct no matter if acceleration is taken into account or not.
	
	From now on, $\mathcal{O}_R$ will be used to denote the resting observer and $\mathcal{O}_M$ to denote the second observer moving at $v$ relative to $\mathcal{O}_R$. If $\mathcal{O}_R$ resting in Earth's orbit measures $\mathcal{O}_M$ to reach $M$ at time $t$, then $\tau = \sqrt{1 - v^2 / c^2} \, t$ has elapsed on a clock carried by $\mathcal{O}_M$. Immediately turning around at Mars and traveling back with velocity $v'$ (could be $v' = v$, but no need for that), then times $t'$ and $\tau' = \sqrt{1 - v'^2 / c^2} \, t'$ elapse for $\mathcal{O}_R$ and $\mathcal{O}_M$, respectively. All in all, for the roundtrip times we have
	\begin{equation*}
		t + t' = \frac{\tau}{\sqrt{1 - v^2 / c^2}} + \frac{\tau'}{\sqrt{1 - v'^2 / c^2}} \geq \tau + \tau' \, .
	\end{equation*}

	Furthermore, there is no ambiguity here in the perception of $\mathcal{O}_M$ because they end up witnessing the same event, $E = E'$, so there can be no ambiguity in simultaneity -- the twin paradox is not paradoxical after all. One can attribute this to the fact that on his journey, the observer $\mathcal{O}_M$ has to turn around in order to come back, so he is changing reference frames on the journey. Hence, three inertial frames are involved in total and there is no frame where the moving observer is stationary over the whole journey, which eliminates a mutual description from moving to resting observer (from all three frames one can prove that less time goes by for observer on the journey, which is the striking part here). This is demonstrated explicitly in the second treatment of this example using spacetime diagrams (example \ref{ex:twin_paradox_2}).
\end{ex}
% Therefore, it is indeed true that less time goes by on moving clocks. This effect has also been verified experimentally. \todo{note Hafele-Keating explicitly. Or make sure was done beforehand} It should be noted, though, that it only becomes relevant for velocities $v \approx c$, otherwise $\sqrt{1 - v^2 / c^2} \approx 1$ and $\tau \approx t$. Once again, we emphasize that this is the reason why the Newtonian way of describing time as an absolute, universal notion has worked for so long and is perhaps also more intuitive.
%
Besides all the theoretical arguments and justification, what ultimately convinces us time dilation is \enquote{real} is experimental evidence. To the best of my knowledge, the Hafele-Keating experiment \cite{Hafele_1972} was the first test of this principle. It successfully confirmed that clocks flown in different direction around the Earth show \\


An interesting consequence of time dilation arises for observers moving with the speed of light, like e.g.~photons. No other light pulse sent from some distance can ever reach them, so how can these observers agree on time measurements with others? Well, they cannot agree because the speed of light is a universal limit, no signal can reach the moving observer, from which we conclude that no time passes for this observer. This result is in accordance with
\begin{equation}
	\tau = \sqrt{1 - c^2 / c^2} \, t = 0 \, .
\end{equation}
This is why particles moving at light speed cannot decay -- they are physically not able to age and reach whatever decay time we might suspect them to have.


\todo{not sure anymore if we can make this statement. Saw discussion that it is not possible to define a frame of reference for a photon (which is true), so such a statement is useless. Not sure what to think of that, though, I mean don't all observers agree on proper times? Then this should be valid, since we have no $1/0$ here...}



		\subsection{Length Contraction}
Time works different in relativity, we must learn to accept that. Part of that is examining induced effects, for example on lengths. After all, when thinking about it a bit more, lengths are defined as readings of a measuring rod/ruler \emph{at the same time}. Since observers have different notions of simultaneity, the very definition of lengths will also be affected by this.


It is natural to say that two rods are of the same length if they have the same length for the referee $\mathcal{R}$ we have already used to define simultaneity. As Fig.~2.11 of \cite{dragon_geometry_srt} illustrates very well (so well that I was not able to reproduce it), the observers do not see both rods to have equal length. Because of them measuring with different notions of simultaneity, they do not agree on lengths. An observer $\mathcal{O}$ who carries a ruler of length $l$ measures the length $l'$ of a ruler carried by an observer $\mathcal{O}'$ moving with velocity $v$ relative to $\mathcal{O}$ to have length
\begin{equation}\label{eq:length_contraction}
	\eqbox{
	l' = \sqrt{1 - v^2 / c^2} \, l
	} \, .
\end{equation}
Again, this effect is mutual. $\mathcal{O}'$ measures a length of
\begin{equation*}
	l = \sqrt{1 - v^2 / c^2} \, l'
\end{equation*}
for a ruler of length $l$ carried by $\mathcal{O}$.



		% \subsection{Doppler Shift \& Aberration}
		\subsection{Doppler Shift}
		\label{subsec:doppler}
Time being different for moving observers has implications on frequencies, which are nothing but inverse period lengths $T$,
\begin{equation}
	f = \frac{1}{T} \, .
\end{equation}
Consequently, the frequency $f$ observed by an observer $\mathcal{O}$ that receives a signal by an emitter $\mathcal{O}'$ moving away from $\mathcal{O}$ with $v$ is
\begin{equation}
	\eqbox{f = \frac{f'}{\kappa(v)}} \, ,
\end{equation}
with $f'$ denoting the frequency of the emitted signal. In words, frequencies are shifted towards lower ones, they are \Def[redshift]{redshifted}, $f < f'$.\footnote{Our chain of arguments is roughly that time intervals are shorter for moving observers and that this also has an effect on frequencies. Another route that one can go, which may be more intuitive, is the following: examine the relative Doppler shift of frequencies and go from this to the time intervals measured by moving observers. Due to longer travel times of light as two observers separate further, the frequency $f'$ observed by the resting observer $\mathcal{O}'$ is larger than the emitted one $f$ (that the moving observer $\mathcal{O}$ emitting the signals would see). Consequently, the observed period is smaller, which is nothing but time dilation.
% Doppler factors could be helpful because frequencies are inverse time intervals, i.e.~through arriving of light signals (thus blue-, redshift), one can argue for time intervals that the observers see as well! Due to longer travel time of light, light signals reach at different times, leading to different perceptions of simultaneity (Wikipedia on twin paradox is nice for that)
}
If $\mathcal{O}'$ would move towards $\mathcal{O}$ with velocity $v$, then $\kappa(-v) = 1 / \kappa(v)$ implies that the received frequencies would be \Def{blueshifted} instead, i.e.~$f > f'$. Having started to argue with these new terms, we should introduce the corresponding physical quantity as well. The \Def{redshift} can be defined as
\begin{equation}
	\eqbox{f = \frac{f'}{1 + z}}
	\quad \Leftrightarrow \quad
	\eqbox{z = \kappa - 1} \, .
\end{equation}


Another name for this effect is \Def{Doppler shift}, which is derived from the term \Def{Doppler factor} for
\begin{equation}\label{eq:doppler_factor}
	\eqbox{\kappa = \sqrt{\frac{1 + v / c}{1 - v / c}} = \frac{1 + v / c}{\sqrt{1 - v^2 / c^2}}}
\end{equation}
(cf.~Eq.~\eqref{eq:doppler_derivation} and the preceding discussion for a derivation). This is the relativistic Doppler effect for a source moving with speed $v$ relative to the receiver, emitting a signal traveling with speed $c$, but with the same factor $\sqrt{1 - v^2 / c^2}$ we already encountered with times and lengths (the origin of this term is the time dilation experienced by a moving observer). For small velocities $v$, it reduces to the classical Doppler effect with
\begin{equation}\label{eq:doppler_class}
	\eqbox{\kappa \simeq 1 + \frac{v}{c}} \, .
\end{equation}
The extra term in Eq.~\eqref{eq:doppler_factor} accounts for time dilation.


Eq.~\eqref{eq:doppler_factor} encapsulates the \Def[Doppler effect!longitudinal]{longitudinal Doppler effect}, where the relative movement of $\mathcal{O}, \mathcal{O}'$ is along the line of sight $\vec{N}$ between them. More generally, we could also have a component of $\vec{v}$ that is not parallel to $\vec{N}$ and correspondingly, a \Def[Doppler effect!transverse]{transverse Doppler effect}. For this, the change in distance is usually negligible between receiver and emitter, so there is no component by the relativistic generalization of the classical Doppler effect \eqref{eq:doppler_class}. However, the source is still potentially moving at relativistic speeds, which means that it is subject to time dilation. Therefore, there is still an effect, namely
\begin{equation}
	\eqbox{f = f' \, \sqrt{1 - v^2 / c^2}} \, .
\end{equation}
In the most general case with both longitudinal and transverse components, the result reads
\begin{equation}\label{eq:general_doppler_v1}
	\eqbox{f = f' \frac{\sqrt{1 - v^2 / c^2}}{1 - v / c \, \cos \theta}} \text{ where } \theta = \angle(\vec{v}, \vec{N}) = \frac{\langle \vec{v}, \vec{N} \rangle}{\norm{v} \norm{N}} \, .
\end{equation}
Basically, we have to replace $v$ by the projection of $\vec{v}$ onto the line of sight in the classical Doppler part of the formula, while no such replacement is needed in the square root because this factor comes from time dilation and is thus related to the actual velocity of the observer, not just its projection. We will not derive this result here, but instead refer to the next section, where it is treated as part of coordinate transformations (alternatively, cf.~\cite{dragon_geometry_srt}).\\


Now we will note down some important properties of the Doppler factor.
\begin{itemize}
	\item From the expression in Eq.~\eqref{eq:doppler} it immediately follows that
	\begin{equation}
		\eqbox{\kappa(-v) = \frac{1}{\kappa(v)}} \, .
	\end{equation}
	This is in contrast to the behavior for times, where $\tau(-v) = \tau(v)$.
	
	
	\item In the proof of Minkowski's theorem \ref{thm:minkowski_moving_clocks}, we had used that the Doppler factors between two observers $\mathcal{O}_1, \mathcal{O}_2$ fulfill
	\begin{equation}
		\eqbox{\kappa_{12} = \kappa_{21}} \, ,
	\end{equation}
	where $\kappa_{12} \coloneqq \kappa(\mathcal{O}_1, \mathcal{O}_2)$.
	
	this assumption is justified because ... ; the Doppler shift is symmetric/mutual
	
	
	\item Through some algebra, one can show that
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:triple_doppler}
		\eqbox{\kappa_{13} = \kappa_{12} \, \kappa_{23}} \, .
	\end{equation}
	Alternatively, one can argue in a similar manner to what we did in the proof of Theorem \ref{thm:minkowski_moving_clocks}, as is done in Sec.~2.2 of \cite{dragon_geometry_srt}. In this source, property \eqref{eq:triple_doppler} is also used to show how relativistic addition of velocities works. But since this is a section about clocks, we will not do that here, but rather refer to Sec.~\ref{subsec:vel_add} for a thorough discussion.
\end{itemize}



		% \subsection{What Is A \enquote{Good} Clock?}
		\subsection{\enquote{Good} Clocks}
we have cared a lot about simultaneity here, and what this required was very precise clocks. however, apart from this high precision, we have not discussed which type of clock is required. to answer this question, we must first think about what even makes a \enquote{good} clock or, equivalently, a \enquote{good} notion of time


what requirements do we even have on a notion of time for it to be considered \enquote{good}? As Misner-Thorne-Wheeler state, it has to make the trajectory of free particles look simple. To see how these trajectories might change depending on this choice (that we have always assumed to be given until now), let us take a look at Eq.~\eqref{eq:newton_2}, which is the equation of motion. For a free particle, $v = \text{const.}$ and thus $F = 0$ -- free particles move in a straight line. However, the denominator contains $t$, just like $v^k = \dv{x^k}{t}$. For this reason, our notion of \enquote{constant} itself depends on the time standard we have chosen! As MTW show very illustratively, if we were to measure time in solar days, this would mean that the distance zurückgelegt in order to keep the velocity constant would change -- which makes it look like a force is at work. This is a very undesirable behaviour -> could even show with chain rule how things look like written out in terms of the usual notion of time, showing that we get something of the form $\dots = \dv{p^k}{t}$


discuss how atomic clocks work, as example of good one? Atoms have very regular frequency, which in turn defines very precise time intervals



\newpage



	\section{Lorentz Transformation}\label{sec:lorentz_transformation_1}
The effects of time dilation and length contraction point to new effects that occur upon changing inertial frames to look at problems. These effects are not predicted by the Galilei transform, which maps spatial coordinates between two inertial frames (one unprimed, one primed, moving relative to each other with velocity $v$) according to 
\begin{equation*}
	x' = x - v t
	\qquad \Leftrightarrow \qquad
	x = x' + v t
\end{equation*}
and does not change time at all, i.e.
\begin{equation*}
	t' = t \, .
\end{equation*}
Over the course of the last sections, however, we have seen that time is a notion which depends on the observer measuring it as well. Therefore, it is natural that it has to be transformed as well. Additionally, observers measure different speeds of light for this Galilei transform, a violation of the relativity principle since observers have to agree on $c$ by postulate \ref{post:c_constant}. The goal of this section is to find a new, corrected transformation between the unprimed and primed coordinates. Note that we will restrict ourselves to one spatial dimension $x$ instead of three for now (a generalized treatment will be done in Sec.~\ref{subsec:lorentz_transformation_2}).\\


Since we now that the Galilei transformation does work for velocities $v \ll c$, there is no need for a completely new expression. Our ansatz can simply be
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lorentz_spatial_ansatz}
	x' = \gamma (x - vt)
	\qquad \text{ and } \qquad
	x = \gamma (x' + vt')
\end{equation}
for some factor $\gamma = \gamma(v)$, which fulfils $\gamma \approx 1$ for $v \ll c$. Note that we have used $\gamma(v) = \gamma(-v)$ here, which is the reason why $x \rightarrow x'$ has the same structure as $x' \rightarrow x$. This is a necessary condition on the transformation (and thus $\gamma$) since otherwise, there would be a preferred direction, which is forbidden by the relativity principle.

To obtain the way $t \rightarrow t'$ transforms, we use postulate \ref{post:c_constant} again, which tells us that $x = ct$ and $x' = ct'$ for light. We can rearrange this to read
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lorentz_time_ansatz}
	ct' = x' = \gamma (x - vt) = \gamma (ct - \frac{v}{c} x)
	\qquad \text{ and } \qquad
	ct = x = \gamma (x' + vt') = \gamma (ct' + \frac{v}{c} x') \, .
\end{equation}
We are free to switch the expressions here since we are looking at light and it is necessary because $t' \overset{!}{=} t$ for $v = 0$.

In the last step, we determine the factor $\gamma$ by inserting Eq.~\eqref{eq:lorentz_time_ansatz} into Eq.~\eqref{eq:lorentz_spatial_ansatz}
\begin{align*}
	x' &= \gamma (x - vt) = \gamma (\gamma (x' + vt') - v \gamma / c (ct' + \frac{v}{c} x'))
	\\
	&= \gamma^2 (x' + vt' - vt' - \frac{v^2}{c^2} x') = \gamma^2 \qty(1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}) x'
\end{align*}
from which we obtain the \Def{Lorentz-factor}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gamma_factor}
	\eqbox{
	\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
	}
\end{equation}
Inserting this result into Eq.~\eqref{eq:lorentz_time_ansatz} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:lorentz_spatial_ansatz} yields the \Def{Lorentz transformation} \todo{call this here Lorentz boost? And mention that they are example of Lorentz transformation, but rotations e.g. are as well}
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:lorentz_trafo}

%\end{alignat}
%
% does not allows eqbox
%
\begin{align}
	\eqbox{
	x' = \gamma \qty(x - vt) = \frac{x - vt}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
	}
	\qquad & \qquad
	\eqbox{
	t' = \gamma \qty(t - \frac{v}{c^2} x) = \frac{t - \frac{v}{c^2} x}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
	}
	\\
	\eqbox{
	x = \gamma \qty(x' + vt') = \frac{x' + vt'}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
	}
	\qquad & \qquad
	\eqbox{
	t = \gamma \qty(t' + \frac{v}{c^2} x') = \frac{t' + \frac{v}{c^2} x'}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
	} \, .
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
Often, one abbreviates $\beta = \frac{v}{c}$, which is the velocity given in multiples of $c$ (equal to $v$ in units where $c = 1$). This set of equations shows how different inertial frames are related, respecting the the constancy of $c$.\footnote{The inertial part is crucial here. It implies that the transformation have to be linear in $x, ct$ since otherwise, $\dv[2]{x'}{t} \neq \dv[2]{x}{t}$ and the frames would not be inertial anymore.}\\


From its definition and Fig.~\ref{fig:gamma_factor}, it is clear that $\gamma$ diverges as $v$ approaches $c$. The Lorentz transformation, on the other hand, does not diverge because of $x = ct$, which implies
\begin{align*}
	x' = \eval{\frac{c - v}{\frac{1}{c^2} \sqrt{c^2 - v^2}}}_{v = c} t = 0
	\manyqquad
	t' = \eval{\frac{c - v}{\frac{1}{c^2} \sqrt{c^2 - v^2}}}_{v = c} \frac{t}{c} = 0 \, .
\end{align*}
Hence, $x' = ct'$ still holds, as required. Them being equal to zero, as measured from the unprimed coordinates, simply comes from the fact that exchanging signals with light is impossible, so one cannot receive any information regarding times $t'$ or positions $x'$.


The other limit we have to check is $v \ll c$, where we should re-obtain the Galilei transform. As Fig.~\ref{fig:gamma_factor} shows, $\gamma$ exhibits the desired behaviour of $\gamma(v) \approx 1, \, v \ll c$. More quantitatively, a Taylor expansion in $v / c$ shows (for one more term, see Eq.~\eqref{eq:taylor_expansion_gamma_2})
\begin{equation}\label{eq:taylor_expansion_gamma}
	\eqbox{\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}} \simeq \eval{\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}}_{v = 0} + \eval{\frac{\frac{-1}{2} \cdot \frac{-2 v}{c}}{(1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2})^{3/2}}}_{v / c = 0} \frac{v}{c} + \dots \eqbox{= 1 + \mathcal{O}\qty(\frac{v^2}{c^2})} \, .
\end{equation}
Combining that with $v \ll c \ll c^2$, we obtain the desired result to zero-th order in $v$:
\begin{equation*}
	x' \simeq x - vt
	\manyqquad
	t' \simeq t
	\, .
\end{equation*}\\



One final note: the derivation presented here is perhaps not be the most rigorous one. Alternatively, one can argue using a diagram like \ref{fig:moving_rod_diagram}, which is the spacetime diagram of a moving rod. Using a bit of geometry, one can show that the angle $\alpha$ between $x, x'$ and the one between $ct, ct'$ are equal. Moreover $ct'$ is the line of equilocality of $x' = 0$, while in unprimed coordinates it is the line $x = vt$. \cite{giulini_srt} argues in detail using $\tan(\alpha) = \frac{v}{c}$ and more relations, which also leads to Eq.~\eqref{eq:lorentz_trafo}. Another approach is mentioned in Sec.~\ref{subsec:lorentz_transformation_2}.

		By definition, the axis $ct'$ is the left end of the rod at $x' = 0$. In the $(ct, x)$-frame, it is given by the line $x = vt$. For the $x'$-axis, one can construct the point on the world line of the right end of the rod that is simultaneous to $t' = 0$ as measured by the left end of the rod. In accordance with the Einstein synchronization, this can be done by looking at light sent out from the origin and its intersection with the midpoint (dashed line).

To obtain the way $t \rightarrow t'$ transforms, we have to think a bit more and in fact, reinterpret the ansatz Eq.~\eqref{eq:lorentz_spatial_ansatz}.

In $x$-coordinates, the point $x' = 0$ moves away at speed $x = vt$


the axis $x'$ is determined from the fact that it consists of all events happening at $t' = 0$, i.e.~those which are simultaneous to origin $(ct', x') = (0, 0)$; we have determined this axis by constructing event $E$ that right end of rod perceives to be simultaneous to $t' = 0$ measured by left end of rod (which crosses origin)

rod does not move in primed coordinates, i.e.~$x' = const$ for it; therefore, by prolonging world line of left end of rod, we get axis where $x' = 0$ for all times $t'$ and thus the axis $ct'$


$\gamma$ is stretching, needed because we know that lengths are measured differently in moving systems

		\subsection{Time Dilation \& Length Contraction 2}\label{subsec:time_dilation_lorentz}
In principle, it is not surprising that a new transformation has to be used. After all, we have demanded some new postulates to be true and there is no reason for the \enquote{old} transformation to fulfill it. On the other hand, we have already examined quite a few predictions of these postulates in the clock section \ref{sec:clocks} and likewise, it is not guaranteed that our new Lorentz transformation reproduces the results which have been found there.

Most prominently, time dilation and length contraction showed up as new effects. We will now check if they can be reproduced in coordinates related via the Lorentz transformation.



			\paragraph{Measuring in Unprimed Coordinates}
Consider a rod with ends at positions $x_1, x_2$. Their spatial distance and thus the length of the rod in unprimed coordinates is
\begin{equation*}
	L = x_2 - x_1 \, .
\end{equation*}

From the primed coordinates, however, one would measure
\begin{equation}\label{eq:length_contraction_not_correct}
	L' = x'_2 - x'_1 = \gamma (x_2 - v t_2) - \gamma (x_1 - v t_1) = \gamma (x_2 - x_1) = \gamma L = \frac{L}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{x^2}}} \, .
\end{equation}
Here we assume $t_1 = t_2$ because by definition, distances are measured at the same time (simultaneously). This result is not what we expect from the previous discussions. Is the Lorentz transformation at fault? Luckily, no. We have emphasized how simultaneity is important for the length to be meaningful. However,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:not_simultaneous}
	t'_1 = \gamma (t_1 - \frac{v}{c^2} x_1) \neq \gamma (t_2 - \frac{v}{c^2} x_2) = t'_2
	\quad \Leftrightarrow \quad
	\Delta t' = t'_2 - t'_1 = \gamma \frac{v}{c^2} (x_1 - x_2) \neq 0
	\, ,
\end{equation}
the measurements in primed coordinates are not simultaneous, so this $L'$ is \emph{not} what a ruler in primed coordinates measures. In order to simulate this result, we have to tune the times $t_1, t_2$ to achieve $t'_1 = t'_2$. Choosing
\begin{equation}
	\Delta t = t_2 - t_1 = - \Delta t' = - \gamma \frac{v}{c^2} (x_1 - x_2) = \frac{v}{c^2} \gamma L
\end{equation}
leads to a cancellation of the time difference in Eq.~\eqref{eq:not_simultaneous}. The \enquote{true} length measured in unprimed coordinates then becomes
\begin{equation}\label{eq:length_contraction_correct}
	\begin{split}
	\eqbox{L'} &= x'_2 - x'_1 = \gamma (x_2 - v t_2) - \gamma (x_1 - v t_1) = \gamma L - v \Delta t
	\\
	&= \gamma L - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \gamma L = \frac{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} L = \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} L = \eqbox{\frac{L}{\gamma}} \, .
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
Moving rulers measure smaller distances, physics is still intact.
Effectively, this corresponds to waiting a longer time until the second measurement in unprimed coordinates, which in turn causes the transformed times $t'_1, t'_2$ to be equal (note that the length $L$ does not change because it is at rest in unprimed coordinates, i.e.~$x_1, x_2$ are constant, independent of time). An intuitive explanation for this is that the moving observer claims the system at rest is moving, i.e.~the end of the rod moves away from him, shortening it. In order to compensate for that, we have to wait a bit longer until taking the second measurement at $t'_2$ and correspondingly, increase $t_2$.\\


Consider a temporal distances $T = t_2 - t_1$ measured by a clock resting in unprimed coordinates (i.e.~$x_1 = x_2$). This time difference measured from primed coordinates is
\begin{equation*}
	%T = t_2 - t_1
	%\qquad \qquad
	T' = t'_2 - t'_1 = \gamma (t_2 - \frac{v}{c^2} x_2) - \gamma (t_1 - \frac{v}{c^2} x_1) = \gamma (t_2 - t_1) = \gamma T = \frac{T}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \, .
\end{equation*}
The primed observer measures a time $T'$ between two events on his clock, while on the clock resting in unprimed coordinates,
\begin{equation}
	\eqbox{
	T = \sqrt{1 - v^2 / c^2} \, T'
	}
\end{equation}
go by. Since the primed observer sees the unprimed one moving, that confirms what we already knew: moving clocks tick slower. This effect can be attributed to the synchronization of clocks. Despite $x_1 = x_2$, $x'_1 \neq x'_2$, so the measurements in primed coordinates are taken by two different clocks (which are properly synchronized, but in the primed frame).



			\paragraph{Measuring in Primed Coordinates}
Now consider a rod with end points at $x'_1, x'_2$. Its length measured from the primed coordinates is
\begin{equation*}\label{eq:rod_primed_coords_from_primed}
	L' = x'_2 - x'_1 \, .
\end{equation*}

This measurement is conducted simultaneously in primed coordinates, so $t'_1 = t'_2$. From unprimed coordinates, however, we measure at $t_1 = t_2$. For this reason, $L'$ becomes
\begin{equation*}
	L' = x'_2 - x'_1 = \gamma (x_2 - v t_2) - \gamma (x_1 - v t_1) = \gamma (x_2 - x_1) = \gamma L \, .
\end{equation*}
Consequently, the length $L$ of the rod measured in unprimed coordinates is
\begin{equation}
	\eqbox{
	L = \frac{L'}{\gamma}
	} \, ,
\end{equation}
which confirms the mutuality of length contraction.


Next, consider a temporal distance $T' = t'_2 - t'_1$ measured by a clock resting in primed coordinates (i.e.~$x'_1 = x'_2$). Measuring in this difference in unprimed coordinates, where the clock has moved from $x_1$ to $x_2 = x_1 + v T, \; T = t_2 - t_1$ during this time, yields
\begin{equation}
	\eqbox{T'} = t'_2 - t'_1 = \gamma (t_2 - \frac{v}{c^2} x_2) - \gamma (t_1 - \frac{v}{c^2} x_1) = \gamma (t_2 - t_1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} T) \eqbox{= \frac{T}{\gamma}} \, .
\end{equation}
Hence, we have also obtained the mutuality of time dilation.\\


Albeit the calculations are largely equivalent, we have argued slightly differently here, which was done deliberately to show there is not a single correct way of calculating the corresponding effects. In the end, we can can confirm that both length contraction and time dilation are reproduced by the Lorentz transformation. Furthermore, the calculations are much more straightforward compared to what had to be done previously (setting up synchronization, drawing complicated diagrams etc.). For this reason, it is customary to introduce the Lorentz transformation without covering any details on clocks. However, in my personal experience, that often results in a lack of intuition on these topics -- one is bound to the understanding in terms of Lorentz transformations, although they are \emph{not} necessary to understand what is going on. Since special relativity is a confusing topic in itself due to several frames and new concepts, intuition is an important part and helps tremendously with interpreting calculations.



		\subsection{Doppler Shift 2}
We had already mentioned that the Doppler effect can also be treated using coordinate transformations. Having introduced the Lorentz transformation in this section, it is now time to do just that. In order to get an idea about the setup we are working with, cf.~Fig.~\ref{fig:doppler_setup}.


During the derivation, we will argue in terms of wave fronts. For now, let us consider the rest frame of the emitting observer $\mathcal{O}'$. We choose our Cartesian coordinate system to have an $x' y'$-plane that coincides with the plane spanned by $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{k}$ (equivalently in our setup: by $\vec{v}$ and the line of sight $\vec{N}$), with the $x'$-axis pointing from $\mathcal{O}$ to $\mathcal{O}'$ (i.e.~$\vec{v} \parallel \vec{e}_{x'}$). Any wave front that moves in $x'$-direction, i.e.~that fulfills $x' = c t'$, can then be described by the four-vector
\begin{equation}
	(c t', x', y', z') = (c (t'_0 + n T'), c (t'_0 + n T'), 0, 0), \; n \in \mathcal{N}
\end{equation}
where $T'$ is the period of the wave ($n$ is the index describing different wave fronts) and the time $t'_0$ we look at (we have omitted any constant coordinate offset because would cancel in diffs \todo{do same with t0? Or just add x0 etc?}). Upon a rotation by $\theta$ (measured counterclockwise) about the $z'$-axis,\footnote{Which can already been seen as the application of a Lorentz transformation.} this can be generalized to arbitrary orientations of the wave vector. The resulting four-vectors read
\begin{equation}
	% (c t', x', y', z') = 
	(c (t'_0 + n T'), c (t'_0 + n T') \cos \theta, c (t'_0 + n T') \sin \theta, 0) \, .
\end{equation}
In this frame, the difference between two wave fronts is
\begin{equation}
	(c T', c T' \cos \theta, c T' \sin \theta, 0) \, ,
\end{equation}
the observed period is indeed $T'$. In order to obtain results seen by the receiver $\mathcal{O}$, which moves relative to this rest frame with velocity $\vec{v}$, we have to look at the wave fronts in the corresponding rest frame. We can do this by performing a Lorentz boost along $\vec{v}$, i.e.~along $\vec{e}_x$, and then calculating the respective quantities in this boosted frame. This yields wave fronts
\begin{equation}
	(\gamma c (t_0 + n T) - \beta \gamma c (t_0 + n T) \cos \theta, \gamma c (t_0 + n T) \cos \theta - (c t_0 + n T), c (t_0 + n T) \sin \theta, 0) \, .
\end{equation}
Therefore, the temporal component (zero-th component divided by $c$) of the difference between successive wave fronts, as seen by $\mathcal{O}$, is
\begin{align}
	& T = \gamma T' - \beta \gamma T' \cos \theta = T' \gamma (1 - v / c \, \cos \theta)
	\notag\\
	\Leftrightarrow \quad & \eqbox{f = \frac{f'}{\gamma (1 - v / c \, \cos \theta)} = \frac{f' \sqrt{1 - v^2 / c^2}}{1 - v / c \, \cos \theta}}
	\label{eq:general_doppler_v2}
	\, .
\end{align}
This is the desired result (cf.~Eq.~\eqref{eq:general_doppler_v1}).\footnote{The more intuitive ansatz may be to look at $\mathcal{O}$ at rest and have the source $\mathcal{O}'$ move relative to it. However, the results would be equivalent due to the relativity principle, we cannot distinguish this situation from the one used during the calculation. In particular, the results are equivalent.} We could also obtain this result by looking at the wave vector $\vec{k}$ of the light in primed and unprimed coordinates, but since the four-vector generalization of $\vec{k}$ has not been introduced yet, we choose not to do this.

	\caption[Visualization of the Doppler effect]{Visualization of the Doppler effect. We show situation in plane spanned by $\vec{v}, \vec{k}$. The dashed line is supposed to indicate a wavefront of the light emitted by $\mathcal{O}'$. Note that we could translate $\mathcal{O}'$ perpendicular to $\vec{k}$ and obtain the same physical situation (if the distance between both observers is sufficiently large, so that $\mathcal{O}$ only receives wave fronts), but to avoid confusion we draw $\vec{k}$ precisely along the line of sight $\vec{N}$ between both observers (which also means that $\theta = \angle (-\vec{N}, \vec{v}) = \pi + \angle (\vec{N}, \vec{v})$). If we were to change the direction in any way that is not perpendicular to $\vec{k}$, this would change the rate at which wave fronts arrive (which are, by definition, perpendicular to $\vec{k}$), i.e.~change the frequency. One can still handle this case by introducing an additional angle into the setup (the one between $\vec{k}, \vec{N}$), but we do not discuss this.}
	\label{fig:doppler_setup}
\end{figure}

% we have to specify direction of emission ($\equiv$ wave vector $\vec{k}$) because, assuming we are far from the source, this specifies orientation of waveform fronts that arrive for us, and thus also the frequency we observe



		\subsection{Addition of Velocities}
		\label{subsec:vel_add}
Let us now turn to velocities in relativity. Intuitively, we expect the velocity of points with fixed coordinates in the primed frame to move with velocity $v$ in the unprimed frame, i.e.~we expect them to fulfill an equation of the form
\begin{equation*}
	x = v t + b
\end{equation*}
for some offset/shift $b$. However, looking at the Lorentz transformation Eq.~\eqref{eq:lorentz_trafo}, we may get confused by all the $\gamma$'s and ask ourselves: is this really the case? Rearranging yields
\begin{equation}
	x = v t + x' / \gamma
\end{equation}
as the world line of a fixed point $x'$ in unprimed coordinates $(x, c t)$. Hence, the velocity of this world line (again, in unprimed coordinates) is
\begin{equation}
	\dv{x}{t} = \dv{t} (v t + x' / \gamma) = v \, .
\end{equation}
Velocities work as expected between two uniformly moving frames.\\


As more frames get involved, something has to be different though. This is because of $c$ being a universal speed limit, so adding velocities in relativity cannot work as before since that would allow velocities $> c$. To find out how it works, let us look at a third frame $(x'', c t'')$ moving with velocity $w$ relative to $(x', c t')$. Inserting the Lorentz transformation twice yields
\begin{align*}
%	x'' &= \gamma_w \qty(x' - w t') = \gamma_w \qty(\gamma_v (x - v t) - w \gamma_v \qty(t - \frac{v}{c^2} x))
%	\notag\\
%	&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - w^2 / c^2}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2 / c^2}} \qty(x + \frac{v w}{c^2} x - (v + w) t)
%	\notag\\
%	&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{(1 + w^2 / c^2) (1 - v^2 / c^2)}} \qty(\qty(1 - \frac{v w}{c^2}) x - (v + w) t)
%	\notag\\
%	&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (v^2 + w^2 + (v w)^2) / c^2}} \qty(\qty(1 + \frac{v w}{c^2}) x - (v + w) t)
%
% Writing out gamma factors not needed, is it?
	x'' &= \gamma_w \qty(x' - w t') = \gamma_w \qty(\gamma_v (x - v t) - w \gamma_v \qty(t - \frac{v}{c^2} x))
	\notag\\
	&= \gamma_v \gamma_w \qty(\qty(1 - \frac{v w}{c^2}) x - (v + w) t)
\end{align*}
Thus, the world line of $x'' = 0$ (convenient choice, no offset, so that velocity can be read off immediately) is given in the unprimed $(x, ct)$-coordinates by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:velocity_addition_parallel}
	x'' = 0
	\qquad \Leftrightarrow \qquad
	x = \frac{v + w}{1 + v w / c^2} \, t
	\qquad \Leftrightarrow \qquad
	\eqbox{
	v +_R w = \frac{v + w}{1 + v w / c^2}
	} \, .
\end{equation}
Relativistic addition of velocities is much more complicated than non-relativistic. But setting $v = c$ we see that
\begin{equation}
	\eqbox{
	c +_R w = \frac{c + w}{1 + c w / c^2} = c \frac{1 + w / c}{1 + w / c} = c
	} \, ,
\end{equation}
the $+_R$ we have derived does admit the correct behaviour. Moreover, for $v, w \ll c$
\begin{equation}\label{eq:velocity_addition_limit}
	v +_R w = \frac{v + w}{1 + v w / c^2} \approx v + w \, ,
\end{equation}
it reduces to the usual addition in the Newtonian limit. Thus, we have to accept that addition now works differently, $+_R$ conforms everything we demand from it.\\


Until now, we have assumed $v, w$ to be parallel because we have only taken into account a single spatial dimension. In the more general case with three spatial dimensions, however,
\begin{equation}
	\eqbox{
	\vec{v} +_R \vec{w} \neq \vec{w} +_R \vec{v}
	} \; \text{ and } \;
	\eqbox{
	\vec{v}_1 +_R (\vec{v}_2 +_R \vec{v}_3) \neq (\vec{v}_1 +_R \vec{v}_2) +_R \vec{v}_3
	} \, ,

adding velocities relativistically is neither commutative nor associative.

		\subsection{Spacetime Diagrams 2}
Even more help with understanding relativity is provided by visualizations like spacetime diagrams, which are especially helpful because one can visualize multiple observers in a single diagram (see e.g.~ Fig.~\ref{fig:moving_rod_diagram} or  Fig.~\ref{fig:spacetime_diagram_two_observers}, where grid lines are shown as well). Essentially, this is a geometric way of visualizing what Lorentz transformations do. By marking the coordinates $(x, ct)$ of an event in a single, resting frame we can immediately read off the coordinates in other frames as well by showing the axes as it is done in \ref{fig:spacetime_diagram_two_observers}. In principle, a Lorentz transformation shifts the points $(x, ct) = (0, ct)$ by $-vt$ to the left. This means the $ct'$-axis is rotated to the left compared to the $ct$-axis, so events would have different positions in diagrams. For this reason, the $ct'$-axis is rotated to the right, such that the position of events stays the same (an analogous argument can be made for the $x'$-axis). Reading off coordinates then works by looking at the transformed lines of simultaneity (parallel to $x'$-axis) and equilocality (parallel to $ct'$-axis), i.e.~projecting the event parallel to these lines until we find the intersection with the $ct'$- and $x$-axis, respectively.


%explanation why primed axes are shifted inwards in Minkowski diagrams: we wish to express these axes in the unprimed coordinate system, i.e.~we do not apply the Lorentz transform from unprimed (at rest) to primed (moving with $v$), but rather the inverse one (thus we have to use $-v$ in transformation) -> better explanation: we wish to draw only one point for events; since a coordinate change from unprimed to primed would rotate the $ct$-axis (where $x = 0$) by $-vt$ and thus to the left ($ct'$ would then by $y$-axis), we have to rotate the $ct'$-axis by the same amount to the right; then, we can read off coordinates of an event in the unprimed and primed frame at once


We have already discussed the causal structure of relativity, timelike trajectories are always in the light cone and spacelike ones are outside of it. For this reason, the events marked by red dots in Fig.~\ref{fig:spacetime_diagram_spacelike} are clearly spacelike. Now we get a a visual explanation of why spacelike events are problematic: while the unprimed, resting observer sees the left event $E_1$ happening before the right one $E_2$, the primed observer sees $E_2$ happening before $E_1$. Thus, if $c$ was not the speed limit and spacelike events were able to communicate with each other, observers could disagree on cause and effect. Luckily, no evidence for such a transmission with $v > c$ has been found (yet), so we do not have to rebuild our understanding of causality.\\

	We can see very nicely how each observer perceives time differently. Events happening simultaneously to both red dots (i.e.~which lie on the line between them at $t = 2$), do \emph{not} happen at $t' = t$, but at $t' = \tau = \sqrt{1 - v^2} \, t$ (which is evident from the fact that the blue dots are at $t' = t$). The same can be said for the moving observer in blue, which sees events at $t = \sqrt{1 - v^2} \, t'$ simultaneous to the blue dots at $t' = 2$. Analogous arguments can be made for positions and equilocality.}

The new addition of being able to depict multiple observers to spacetime diagrams makes them a powerful tool suitable to explain many effects of relativity. For example, the fairly complicated twin paradox can be explained and -- perhaps, even more important -- visualized conveniently.



% To get $t''_{TE}$, we have to prolong the axes of simultaneity of the primed coordinates and count the number of time units which go by between the intersections of them with $ct''$ (i.e.~the number of intersections with green lines on the way). This yields roughly $t''_{TE} \gtrsim 1.5$ again. For the time passing simultaneously on a clock in primed coordinates, we can read off roughly $t'_{TE} \approx 4$. The correct numbers can be obtained from Minkowski's theorem again:


\begin{ex}[Twin Paradox 2]\label{ex:twin_paradox_2}
	
	% here is what we should do: calculate ONCE $t_{ES}, t'_{ST}, t'_{ET}$, i.e.~the respective times measured by observer that rests on the trajectory covered between the events (we know how this works thanks to Minkowski theorem). After that, we go on to show that the time for observer traveling from $S$ to $E$ directly and the time for an observer traveling from $S$ to $E$ through $T$ take the same values (not that they are equal, their values when calculated in different frames are equal), no matter which frame we choose to calculate the values

	% -> therefore, it is ok that observers infer different time differences between $S$ and $E$, in the sense that $t_{SE} \neq t'_{SE} \neq t''_{SE}$, the readings of their own clocks do not agree on this time difference. This is not unphysical because all observers can claim that the others are moving with respect to each other. However, when we ask what time each of these clocks infer for the observer resting in the unprimed frame, calculating this from the readings $t_{SE}, t'_{SE}, t''_{SE}$ shows that they do agree on this statement (and also on the time it takes for an observer on the red line \todo{should we draw line with other color to have better reference for observer? Or adopt from caption, O and O'?}). In other words, when asking the relevant questions/asking questions more precisely, we do get see that physics is intact and results are frame-independent. The hard part is to accept that comparing times by directly comparing different readings (i.e.~without gamma factors) is not a precisely asked question anymore \todo{better, more precise wording for last sentence, but I think this is important point; due to abandonment of absolute time, a direct comparison of different clock readings is not something meaningful anymore. We must rather specify very precisely which clock reading we refer to in order to have a truly meaningful comparison.}


	% \hrule

	As promised, here comes the detailed treatment of the twin paradox, which has been started in Example \ref{ex:twin_paradox_1}. We will discuss the setup shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:twin_paradox}, i.e.~treat one observer $\mathcal{O}$ that goes straight from event $S$ (where the clocks of all observers are synchronized) to event $E$ (where the observers meet again), and one observer $\mathcal{O}'$ that goes through $T$ on its way to $S$ (these names following the nomenclature detailed in the caption of Fig.~\ref{fig:twin_paradox}). The times that a clock moving along these two worldlines we show will be denoted by $\tau_{\mathcal{O}}$ (time passed on purple path) $\tau_{\mathcal{O}'}$ (time passed on red path). The relative velocities between $\mathcal{O}'$ and $\mathcal{O}$ is $v_1 = 0.5 c$ between $S, T$ and $v_2 = -0.5 c$ between $T, E$.
	
	One final note concerns the velocities involved: $v_1$ corresponds to the velocity of the primed observer relative to the unprimed one; $v_2$ corresponds to the velocity of the double-primed observer relative to the unprimed one; hence, the velocity of the primed observer relative to the double-primed one is
	\begin{equation}
		v_3 = \frac{0.5 c + 0.5 c}{1 + 0.5^2} = 0.8 c \, .
	\end{equation}\\


	Our intention in this example is to demonstrate the equivalence of the viewpoint of all three observers involved in the journey, the unprimed, primed, and double-primed one.
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Measuring from unprimed frame}

		We have drawn events with
		\begin{equation}
			t_S = -2
			\manyqquad
			t_T = 0
			\manyqquad
			t_E = 2
			\, ,
		\end{equation}
		where in arbitrary time units (one time unit corresponds to the difference between successive grid lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:twin_paradox}). Consequently,
		\begin{equation}
			\tau_{\mathcal{O}} = t_{SE} = t_E - t_S = 4 \, .
		\end{equation}
		Here we use that $\mathcal{O}$ is resting in the unprimed frame, so that the times $t$ recorded by a clock in this frame directly correspond to the proper time experienced by this observer.

		To calculate the proper time for $\mathcal{O}'$, we can use either Lorentz transformations or Minkowski's theorem:
		\begin{equation}
		\begin{split}
			\tau_{\mathcal{O}'} &= \tau_{\mathcal{O}', ST} + \tau_{\mathcal{O}', TE} = \sqrt{1 - v_1^2 / c^2} t_{ST} + \sqrt{1 - v_2^2 / c^2} t_{TE}
			\\
			&= \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} \cdot 2 + \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} \cdot 2 = 1.732 + 1.732 = 3.464 \, .
		\end{split}
		\end{equation}
		Here we have assumed that the time needed to turn around in $T$ is negligible, so that the total travel time is just composed of the uniform motions between $S, T$ and $T, E$.\footnote{Argue this is justified from later considerations, clock postulate. Another indication that this is ok is Dragon argument, we can also accelerate $\mathcal{O}$ during this time by same amount, so that in comparison of the times passed for both, this contribution indeed cancels out.}
		
		We see that indeed, less time goes by for the moving observer, when analyzing the situation from the unprimed frame. What about the other frames, though? Is there still a reciprocity of this statement?


		\item \textbf{Measuring from primed frame}
		
		We know from Lorentz transform which time is passing on clock in unprimed frame between $S, T$ (or we could read it off from Fig.~\ref{fig:twin_paradox} (b)). But we need between $T, E$. For this we use that we know time passing on clock in double-primed frame between $T, E$, as well as relative velocity of the frames.


		% An observer resting in the primed frame would observe that on his clock, the time passing between $S$ and $E$ is
		% \begin{equation}
		% 	t'_{SE} = \frac{t_{SE}}{\sqrt{1 - (-v_1)^2 / c^2}} = \frac{4}{\sqrt{1 - 0.5^2}} = 4.619 \, .
		% \end{equation}

		As we can read off from the lines of simultaneity of the primed axes (i.e.~the lines parallel to $x'$) in each of the diagrams in Fig.~\ref{fig:twin_paradox} (though it is most conveniently done from (b)), an observer resting in the primed frame would observe that on his clock, the time passing between different pairs of events are
		\begin{equation}
			t'_{ST} = 1.732
			\manyqquad
			t'_{TE} = 2.887
			\manyqquad
			t'_{SE} = 4.619 \, .
		\end{equation}
		However, we are not really interested in these quantities.
		As of now, it may look like there is a discrepancy here because $t'_{SE}$ is different from the time $t_{SE}$ inferred in unprimed frame.
		But both Lorentz transformations and Minkowski's theorem tell that $t'_{SE}$ is not the that passes for an observer on the purple worldline because this observer $\mathcal{O}$ is not at rest in the primed frame. Instead, the time inferred for $\mathcal{O}$ from the primed frame is
		\begin{equation}
			\tau_{\mathcal{O}} = \sqrt{1 - (v_1)^2 / c^2} t'_{SE} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} \cdot 4.619 = 4 \, .
		\end{equation}
		Similarly, the time for $\mathcal{O}'$ is
		\begin{equation}
		\begin{split}
			\tau_{\mathcal{O}'} &= \tau_{\mathcal{O}', ST} + \tau_{\mathcal{O}', TE} = t'_{ST} + \sqrt{1 - (-v_3)^2 / c^2} t'_{TE}
			\\
			&= 1.732 + \sqrt{1 - 0.8^2} \cdot 2.887 = 1.732 + 1.732 = 3.464 \, .
		\end{split}
		\end{equation}
		These are the same results that we obtained from the unprimed coordinates.


		\item \textbf{Measuring from double-primed frame}

		Here as well we can read off the measured times, which now read
		\begin{equation}
			t''_{ST} = 2.887
			\manyqquad
			t''_{TE} = 1.732
			\manyqquad
			t''_{SE} = 4.619 \, .
		\end{equation}
		We saw the exact same numbers for the primed observer already, which is caused by $\abs{v_1} = \abs{v_2}$ and shows the reciprocity of time dilation. For this reason, it is not surprising that
		\begin{equation}
			\tau_{\mathcal{O}} = \sqrt{1 - (v_2)^2 / c^2} t''_{SE} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} \cdot 4.619 = 4
		\end{equation}
		and
		\begin{equation}
		\begin{split}
			\tau_{\mathcal{O}'} &= \tau_{\mathcal{O}', ST} + \tau_{\mathcal{O}', TE} = \sqrt{1 - (v_3)^2 / c^2} t'_{ST} + t''_{TE}
			\\
			&= \sqrt{1 - 0.8^2} \cdot 2.887 + 1.732 = 1.732 + 1.732 = 3.464 \, ,
		\end{split}
		\end{equation}
		the results in the double-primed frame are also the same as the ones from before.
	\end{itemize}

	In summary, we see that all observers can agree on the value of proper times, in this case $\tau_{\mathcal{O}}, \tau_{\mathcal{O}'}$. In particular, they all conclude that less time passes for the observer moving at higher speed (although they do not agree on the speeds of each $\mathcal{O}, \mathcal{O}'$).

	Before, we might have been puzzled by the reciprocity of relativistic effects such as time dilation. But in some sense, this example should clear up some of the confusion, by teaching us a very profound truth: we must be mindful which questions to ask in relativity. As we have seen, asking for the time between two events is not well-posed since it cannot be answered unambiguously (simultaneity is relative). The speed of observers? Is also not well-posed, again due to the relativity principle. But this example shows: the time passing for an observer is well-defined and different observers can agree on it -- despite the fact that they do not agree on the time between the events in their frame, and also not on the speed of the observers (which is, again, fine because there is no preferred observer).

	% conclude that all observers can agree on proper time (which explains why we get same values for $\tau_{\mathcal{O}}, \tau_{\mathcal{O}'}$ in each frame). and that indeed, less time goes by for moving observers. but before we had ambiguity because it was not clear which observer was moving, due to relativity principle, every observer can claim to be at rest. but now, we clearly have a difference in velocities between $\mathcal{O}, \mathcal{O}'$ (no matter which frame we look at; this statement is true even if we are not in rest frame of $\mathcal{O}'$)

	The main conclusion of this example can be formulated as follows: as long as we ask meaningful questions, we get consistent results. The strange thing to accept in relativity is that asking for the time between two events is not a meaningful question anymore. Instead, we must always specify which clock we refer to that is measuring the time between events, because in spacetime, the spatial path taken by this clock matters too.

Similarly, we could also prolong them until they intersect the time axis of any other frame $\mathcal{O}'$. In this case, counting the number of time steps passing between the intersection points on the time axis of $\mathcal{O}'$ would yield the time passing for $\mathcal{O}'$, measured from $\mathcal{O}$.}
