## Description
This repository is a collection of notes (mostly based on lectures), which I
wrote and used throughout my physics studies at Leibniz University Hannover.


* `analysis`: a summary of courses I took covering many aspects of analysis
  (the mathematical topic). This includes basic topics like sets, topology,
  differentiation and also more advanced ones like manifolds, Riemannian/
  differential geometry. Written in german.

* `probability`: a summary of one course I took on probability theory/
  statistics and data analysis. Written in english.

* `mechanics`: a summary of several courses I took on various aspects of
  classical mechanics. These include the Lagrange and Hamilton formalism
  as well as statistical mechanics. Written in german (largely unfinished).

* `relativity`: a summary of general relativity courses I took, plus what
  I have learnt about special relativity. Written in english (largely unfinished).
