## Description
This repository is a collection of notes (mostly based on lectures), which I
wrote and used throughout my physics studies at Leibniz University Hannover.


* `analysis`: a summary of courses I took covering many aspects of analysis
  (the mathematical topic). This includes basic topics like sets, topology,
  differentiation and also more advanced ones like manifolds, Riemannian/
  differential geometry. Written in german.

* `probability`: a summary of one course I took on probability theory/
  statistics and data analysis. Written in english.
